After his death, his son, James, decided to look into the lives of his father, the other men in the photo, and the Marines who served with them in the Pacific battle. Stephen Hoye reads convincingly with the voice of a loving son while bringing the rest of the story alive with dramatic urgency. Listeners may find his retelling of battle scenes too graphic. The experiences recalled here are fascinating, and the personal aspects give insight into the minds of those who serve. \n       \n      \n \nHistory ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ 13.5 hrs.
