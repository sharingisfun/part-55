More than a few Americans feared that the world was right. In Washingtonâ€™s Circle, we see how Washington and his trusted advisers, close friends, and devoted family defied the doomsayers to lay the foundation for an enduring constitutional republic. This is a fresh look at an aloof man whose service in the Revolutionary War had already earned him the acclaim of fellow citizens. Washington was easy to revere, if difficult to know.\r\n \r\nDavid S. Heidler and Jeanne T. Heidler reveal Washingtonâ€™s character through his relationship with his inner circle, showing how this unlikely group created the office of the presidency. Here is a story of cooperation, confrontation, triumph, and disappointment, as the president, Congress, and the courts sorted out the limits of executive power, quarreled over funding the government, coped with domestic strife, and faced a world at war while trying to keep their country at peace.\r\n \r\nEven more, it is a story of remarkable people striving for extraordinary achievements. Many of these characters are familiar as historic icons, but in these pages they act and speak as living individuals: the often irked and frequently irksome John Adams, in the vice presidency; the mercurial Alexander Hamilton, leading the Treasury Department; the brilliant, deceptively cunning Thomas Jefferson, as secretary of state; James Madison, who was Washingtonâ€™s advocateâ€”and his eyes and earsâ€”in Congress; and Washingtonâ€™s old friend and former brother-in-arms Henry Knox, at the administrationâ€™s beleaguered War Department. Their stories mingle with those of Edmund Randolph, John Jay, Gouverneur Morris, and the others who stood with a self-educated Virginia farmer to forge the presidency into an institution protective of its privileges but respectful of congressional prerogatives.\r\n \r\nWritten with energy, wit, and an eye for vivid detail, Washingtonâ€™s Circle is the fascinating account of the people who met the most formidable challenges of the governmentâ€™s earliest hours with pluck, ability, and enviable resourcefulness. When the world said they would fail, they rolled up their sleeves. This is their story","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f36ba186e609d598fb8ff8cf1a1e871ec2eef50","amp;dn":"Washington%27s+Circle+-The+Creation+of+the+President+%282015%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f36ba186e609d598fb8ff8cf1a1e871ec2eef50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,54,186,24,110,96,157,89,143,184,255,140,241,161,232,113,236,46,239,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
