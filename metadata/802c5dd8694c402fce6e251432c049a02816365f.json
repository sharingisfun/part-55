I just thought it would be nice to watch some chess lectures while sitting on the buss or whatever. Just dont complain to me if you miss your stop :)\n\nI used a conversion program from this site to convert the original wmv files: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.videora.com/en-us/Converter/iPod-touch/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.videora.com/en-us/Converter/iPod-touch/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNote that if the video dont sync with audio (it happens sometimes the first time you play a file), then just rewind back to beginning and everything is in sync for the rest of the session.\n\n\nIf anyone can give me a hint about the best method to trap (rip) streaming videos from the http://www.chesslecture.com/ site on to my hard drive, I would be very thankful. \n\nThis is my first torrent so comments are welcome :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:802c5dd8694c402fce6e251432c049a02816365f","amp;dn":"Chesslecture+videos+for+your+Ipod+Touch+%28or+Nano%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"802c5dd8694c402fce6e251432c049a02816365f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,44,93,216,105,76,64,47,206,110,37,20,50,192,73,160,40,22,54,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
