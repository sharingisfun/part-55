Remarkably Vondrackova remained popular after Czechoslovakia&amp;#039;s transition in the early 1990s, a feat managed by few Czechoslovak artists. She is also exceptional as a Czech singer for having achieved some limited international musical success.\nVondrÃƒÂ¡?kovÃƒÂ¡ was the daughter of Bla?ena and Ji?ÃƒÂ­ VondrÃƒÂ¡?ek. Much of her childhood was spent in the Bohemian village of Slatinany.\nIn addition to singing, VondrÃƒÂ¡?kovÃƒÂ¡ has written several books (mostly autobiographical) and has appeared in several Czechoslovak and Czech films. She is a friend of Maryla Rodowicz, the Polish pop-star. In 1977 Helena won the first prize at the Sopot Festival (Poland) with her biggest hit MalovanÃƒÂ½ d?bÃƒÂ¡nku. She sings in Czech, Polish, German, Russian, English and Japanese.\n\nmore on &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena_Vondr%C3%A1%C4%8Dkov%C3%A1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena_Vondr%C3%A1%C4%8Dkov%C3%A1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e93b148f28ac9f04ecb8bb754067e8f81858d1b9","amp;dn":"Helena+Vondrackova+-+Golden+Collection+4CD+1964-2005+%282005%29+%5Bmp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e93b148f28ac9f04ecb8bb754067e8f81858d1b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,59,20,143,40,172,159,4,236,184,187,117,64,103,232,248,24,88,209,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
