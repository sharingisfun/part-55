The summer of 1989 was the summer of acid house in Great Britain, and plenty of folks who had previously been plying their trade in indie guitar bands suddenly hooked themselves up with some baggy clothes and a sampler. So in many ways, this is a shameless, pandering sellout. What saves the album is that it&amp;#039;s fully aware that it&amp;#039;s a shameless, pandering sellout, and it&amp;#039;s ok with that. The deadpan objectification of the opening &quot;Manchester&quot; is so over the top in its praise that Ball is clearly taking the mickey. The rest of the album alternates between computerized acid house throb and solo acoustic miniatures like &quot;No Love on Haight Street,&quot; which would not sound out of place on a late-era Felt album.
