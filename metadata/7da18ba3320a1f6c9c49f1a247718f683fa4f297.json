The story in both the book and the play is told by a 15-year-old boy who finds other people frightening and confusing, and it has helped transform our understanding of a neurological condition that affects one in a hundred children. Imagine meets those involved in the play, from early rehearsals and research to stage performances in both London and New York. This is interwoven with moving testimony from other children and families on the challenges they face as they live with autism","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7da18ba3320a1f6c9c49f1a247718f683fa4f297","amp;dn":"imagine.My.Curious.Documentary.EN.SUB.HEVC.x265.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7da18ba3320a1f6c9c49f1a247718f683fa4f297","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,161,139,163,50,10,31,108,156,73,241,162,71,113,143,104,63,164,242,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
