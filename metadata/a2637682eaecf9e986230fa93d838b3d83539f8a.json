Jones) or the American musician Kid Congo Powers (The Gun Club, The Cramps, Nick Cave &amp; Bad Seeds...) among others.\nHere you will find, among other wonders, the original version of the song which became a hit afterwards with Beasts Of Bourbon, &quot;hard for you&quot;. This edition compiles the LP and EP released by this band in between 1988 and 1990, and which are totally impossible to find nowadays. These 15 tracks are all the band recorded.\nLimited edition deluxe on double gatefold LP (500 handnumbered copies) and triple cover digipack CD, noted by Tex Perkins, and with never previously released pictures, it is proudly presented by Bang! Rcds in order to put again in the market this master piece of sonic swamp sound.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2637682eaecf9e986230fa93d838b3d83539f8a","amp;dn":"Butcher+Shop+-+Pump+Action","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2637682eaecf9e986230fa93d838b3d83539f8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,99,118,130,234,236,249,233,134,35,15,169,61,131,139,61,131,83,159,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
