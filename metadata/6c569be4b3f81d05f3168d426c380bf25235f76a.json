He escapes after the war to Germany, where he refines his scrappiness. With the assistance of a family in Salem, Massachusetts, he and his immediate family move to Salem, where he works hard, finishes high school, marries a local girl, joins the Army, and becomes a Green Beret. No fiction writer could have invented this saga. Brian Emerson has a resonant baritone that is stately in delivery. He is clear in his pronunciation and does well with the various non-English names and words. His delivery of dialogue is appropriately expressive. M.T.F.
