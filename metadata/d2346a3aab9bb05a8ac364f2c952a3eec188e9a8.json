Now, he has learned of a plot to steal the Declaration, and has only one option: steal it himself. Even if he pulls off this monumental task, keeping the treasure safe is still going to be incredibly hard, especially since the FBI has also gotten wind of the scheme. \n\nDirector:         Jon Turteltaub\n\nCountry:          USA\n\nTransfer Format:  1080p \n\nYear:             2004\n\nRunning Time:     131 min\n\nIMDB:            &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368891/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368891/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFinalcodec Player \n\ndownload                                                                       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.siluhd.com/soft/FinalCodecs2008sp.exe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.siluhd.com/soft/FinalCodecs2008sp.exe&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nOther movies visit                                                                          \n\n                 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/accpt7506_siluer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/accpt7506_siluer&lt;/a&gt;\t\n\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2346a3aab9bb05a8ac364f2c952a3eec188e9a8","amp;dn":"National.Treasure.2004.Blu-ray.Re.x264.1080P.AC3.DualAudio-C%40Sil","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2346a3aab9bb05a8ac364f2c952a3eec188e9a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,52,106,58,171,155,176,90,138,195,100,242,201,82,163,238,193,136,233,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
