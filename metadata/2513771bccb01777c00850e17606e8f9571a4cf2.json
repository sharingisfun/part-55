Super agent James West and Artemus Gordon have been in retirement for years.

It won&amp;#039;t be easy, for it seems he&amp;#039;s managed to develop the atomic bomb, about half a century ahead of its time. \n\nStars:Robert Conrad as Jim West and Ross Martin as Artemus Gordon\nGuest stars: Paul Williams (Dr. Miguelito Loveless,Jr.), Harry Morgan (Robert T. &amp;#039;Skinny&amp;#039; Malone), Jo Ann Harris (Carmelita Loveless), Trisha Noble (Penelope Devaraux, British Intelligence), Jeff MacKay (Hugo Kaufman), Susan Blu (Gabrielle Jackson), Robert Shields (Alan (Miguelito&amp;#039;s $600 bionic man)), Lorene Yarnell (Sonia (Miguelito&amp;#039;s $600 bionic woman)), Rene Auberjonois (Captain Sir David Edney)\nWriter: William Bowers\nDirector: Burt Kennedy\n\nDVD&gt;XviD/640x480//1Mbps/23.97fps\nmp3/56Mbps/44KHz/Stereo/96min/799Mb &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080132/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080132/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLeave a comment if you&amp;#039;d like more RetroTV specials!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2513771bccb01777c00850e17606e8f9571a4cf2","amp;dn":"TheWildWildWest+REVISITED+1979+%28dvdrip%29+%5Bretr%3Ftv%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2513771bccb01777c00850e17606e8f9571a4cf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,19,119,27,204,176,23,119,192,8,80,225,118,6,232,249,87,26,76,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
