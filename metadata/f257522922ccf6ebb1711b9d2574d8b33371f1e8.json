It claims that the September 11, 2001 attacks were planned and conducted by elements within the United States government, and bases these claims on perceived anomalies in the historical record of the attacks. The film was originally released through the creators&amp;#039; own company, Louder than Words, and received widespread attention after Loose Change 2nd Edition was featured on a Binghamton, New York local FOX affiliate, WICZ-TV (FOX 40).[1] Media outlets,[2][3] independent researchers,[4][5] and prominent members of the scientific and engineering community[6] argue that the film&amp;#039;s main claims are false. Some of the theories presented are supported by academics associated with the 9/11 Truth Movement.[7][8]\n\nThe original film was edited and re-released as Loose Change 2nd Edition, and then subsequently re-edited again for the 2nd Edition Recut, each time to tighten the focus on certain key areas and to remove what the filmmakers believed to be inaccuracies and copyrighted material. Loose Change Final Cut was released in DVD format on November 11, 2007.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f257522922ccf6ebb1711b9d2574d8b33371f1e8","amp;dn":"Loose+Change+1nd+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f257522922ccf6ebb1711b9d2574d8b33371f1e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,87,82,41,34,204,246,235,177,113,27,157,37,116,216,179,51,113,241,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
