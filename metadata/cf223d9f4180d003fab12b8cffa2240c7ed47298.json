Now,\nyou  have  been  attached  by  special  order  to  Whiskey\nCompany, an elite commando team, for what should have been\na simple mission: Capture and detain Roland Kane from  his\nfortress on a worthless,  backwater  planet.  Kane  is  an\nescaped war criminal, the once-legendary  leader  of  Wolf\nPack...and your former mentor.\n\nUnbeknownst to you and your team, Kane is in command of  a\nsecret paramilitary  force  funded  by  the  Mendel-Gruman\n(M-G) Corporation. As Whiskey  Company&amp;#039;s  ship  approaches\nthe planet, it is blasted out of the sky by Kane&amp;#039;s troops.\nNow you find  yourself  stranded  in  a  dangerous  world.\nVicious prehistoric beasts of all shapes  and  sizes  roam\nthe terrain, attacking anything that  moves.  Your  latest\nmission might end up being your last mission - for all the\nwrong reasons.\n\nYour ship is in  pieces  and  your  teammates  are  either\nkilled or scattered to the winds. Ruthless M-G forces  and\nvoracious, bloodthirsty dinosaurs  are  hunting  down  the\nones that are not dead. Your weapons  are  not  with  you.\nYour mission has  become  fatally,  unrelentingly  simple:\nsurvive at all costs.\n\nPROPER NOTES\n\nRAZOR1911 gave up trying to rebuild the game code  because\nof all their previous fuck-ups and decided  to  create  an\nemulator for the SecuROM VM.\n\nTheir emulator crashes inside the VM  after  entering  the\nSecuROM virtual machine at this spot:\n\n0040CDBC   68 361C4000      PUSH TurokGam.00401C36\n0040CDC1   68 D0CD4000      PUSH TurokGam.0040CDD0\n0040CDC6   68 10A4EF00      PUSH TurokGam.00EFA410\n0040CDCB   C3               RETN\n\na crash will happen here:\n\n0193DABD   52               PUSH EDX\n0193DABE   51               PUSH ECX\n0193DABF   0000             ADD BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],AL\n0193DAC1   0068 02          ADD BYTE PTR DS:[EAX+2],CH\n0193DAC4   0000             ADD BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],AL\n0193DAC6   00FF             ADD BH,BH\n0193DAC8   D250 8B          RCL BYTE PTR DS:[EAX-75],CL\n0193DACB   53               PUSH EBX\n0193DACC   2881 C2140000    SUB BYTE PTR DS:[ECX+14C2],AL\n\nWe won&amp;#039;t mention their other fuckups, it&amp;#039;s up to  them  to\nfind them.\n\nIt&amp;#039;s sad to see  that  groups who were  respected  in  the\nold days are simply not good at cracking anymore and force\na position by immature actions.
