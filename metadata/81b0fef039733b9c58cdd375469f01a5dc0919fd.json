The tracks consist of the leftover material from Beck&amp;#039;s album Golden Feelings. Beck was most likely not going to release any of the recordings and had probably forgotten about them at the actual time Golden Leftovers leaked onto the Internet. It has been said that someone at Sonic Enemy leaked it to the public, cleverly, while Beck was at the height of his fame. Many of the songs had either been used on previous demos by Beck or would go on to be used on future Albums and/or Singles. &quot;Mexico&quot;, &quot;Death Is Coming To Get You&quot;, &quot;Yr Love Is Weird&quot;, &quot;Head Cut Off&quot;, &quot;Slimy Power Chick&quot; and &quot;Mattress&quot; were the only tracks that Beck didn&amp;#039;t come back to on any of his official future releases.\n\n(wkwkwk)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81b0fef039733b9c58cdd375469f01a5dc0919fd","amp;dn":"golden+leftovers+%28golden+feelings+outtakes%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81b0fef039733b9c58cdd375469f01a5dc0919fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,176,254,240,57,115,59,156,88,205,211,117,70,159,1,165,220,9,25,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
