New and unique functionality provides access to live on demand streams for over 3000 \nmovies and TV shows, a Live Radio feature so you can listen to over 500 top live radio stations, and a Game Player with \naccess to over 1000 fun games. Other features include the ability to browse the most popular downloads, publish a personal \nrating of your favorites, preview files while downloading, an intuitive user interface, and enhanced parental controls \nthrough the use of built-in keyword filters.\n\nMp3 Rocket uses the Limewire searching engine but is lighter on system resources. Personally IÃ‚Â´m tired with \nlimewire because it takes so much system resources. \n\nJUST UNZIP OR UNRAR, THEN INSTALL AND ENJOY. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28a7b2eaa13c7b0584d3a1a6c1f49e6cdc5897cc","amp;dn":"mp3rocketpro5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28a7b2eaa13c7b0584d3a1a6c1f49e6cdc5897cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,167,178,234,161,60,123,5,132,211,161,166,193,244,158,108,220,88,151,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
