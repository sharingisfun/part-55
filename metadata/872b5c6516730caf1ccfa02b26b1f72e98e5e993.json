When I first got my hands on the Radio Dramas in 1998, I loved em, but being an impatient kid, it bugged me when the narrator told me stuff I already knew, and him piping up every 30 minutes to tell me what I&amp;#039;d just heard and what I was about to hear just sort of got in the way of the universe that was unfolding in my head. \n\nSo, in 2000, with a copy of the soundtracks, some isolated sound effects, and a copy of Cool Edit Pro 1.2, I edited together a more cinematic version of the Radio Dramas. There is no narration anymore. The individual 30 minute episodes have been trimmed up and rejoined as 70-80 minute &quot;parts.&quot; The opening credits kick off part 1, and the closing credits are the last thing you hear on the final part. Thus making &quot;A New Hope&quot; go from 13 half hour episodes to 4 seventy-minute parts. &quot;Empire&quot; goes from 10 half hours to 3 parts, and Jedi goes from 6 half hours to 2 parts. I hope you find this new listening experience a little more immersing and enjoyable.&quot;\n\n\n\n\nLegacy Era is coming up soon!\nThe last book was recently released so I&amp;#039;m waiting for the audio book so I can upload the full Era, not 8 out of 9.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:872b5c6516730caf1ccfa02b26b1f72e98e5e993","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+-+Bonus+Material","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"872b5c6516730caf1ccfa02b26b1f72e98e5e993","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,43,92,101,22,115,12,175,28,207,160,43,38,177,247,46,152,229,233,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
