KEM and a group of friends innocently fell victim to a group of doped-up foreign kickboxing fighters looking for trouble where ultimately, KEMÃƒÂ¢??s father was killed on the scene.\n\nNow an orphan, KEM moved to live in a nearby temple where the head monk became his guardian. Often blaming himself for his fatherÃƒÂ¢??s death, KEM would secretly learn Thai boxing at a local MUAY THAI bar belonging to his friendÃƒÂ¢??s father, UNCLE PRAOW. Time passes on and KEM grows up in the Muay Thai fighting scene. Without his monk guardianÃƒÂ¢??s acknowledgement, KEM learns to make a living off of rigged fighting matches where he fakes a defeat to his foreign Muay Thai opponents in exchange for their tips.\n\nUncle PraowÃƒÂ¢??s Muay Thai fighting bar becomes the local attraction for visiting foreigners and word gets out to JOHN, a leader of a Muay Thai fighting team made up of foreigners called K-1. They travel to Phi Phi Island looking to buyout the bar using the facility to set up their own Muay Thai training camp, but Uncle Praow refuses to sell his property. Displeased, K-1 assaults Uncle Praow, Kem, and the employees of the bar.\n\nIn fear for KEMÃƒÂ¢??s life and not wanting to repeat what happened to his father, KemÃƒÂ¢??s monk guardian takes him off the island to become a student of his friend, an old Muay Thai Master.\n\nIt is here that Kem learns the disciplines of the ancient Thai boxing of Fighting Beat known for fighting bare-handedly dated back to a Thai history of battle where these techniques were used in combat distinguished by 4 different regional styles from the North, South, Central, and Eastern parts of Thailand with each style owning its uniqueness and strengths.\n\nKEM returns to Phi Phi Island to find that Uncle Praow&amp;#039;s bar had been forcefully taken over by K-1, the same group responsible for his father&amp;#039;s death.\nThings turn violent when K-1 refuses to return the bar and KEM is forced to use his Muay Thai disciplines in order to protect himself and his friends.\n\nThe deadliest street fight is set when the ancient disciplines of Fighting Beat Thai boxing (quick, reactive, fierce, and deadly) come face to face with a modern day adapted form of Thai kickboxing combat of K-1.\n\nKEM is put to the test while caught up in this deadly street fight. Can he overcome his feelings of revenge and rage by practicing the disciplines he has learned of the art of Fighting Beat: Muay Thai Chaiya?....
