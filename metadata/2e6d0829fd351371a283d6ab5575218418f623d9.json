In 2006 they reunited to record three new songs for their compilation album, Black Sabbath - The Dio Years. It was during this time that they decided to embark on a 2007-2008 tour, during which time Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne was scheduled to be performing a solo tour. Because of this, and the band&amp;#039;s entry into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Iommi (who owns the name Black Sabbath) decided to call the touring group Heaven and Hell.\n\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e6d0829fd351371a283d6ab5575218418f623d9","amp;dn":"Heaven+and+Hell+-+The+Mob+Rules","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e6d0829fd351371a283d6ab5575218418f623d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,109,8,41,253,53,19,113,162,131,214,171,85,117,33,132,24,246,35,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
