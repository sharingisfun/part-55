You must see this one.  The opening 10 minutes is priceless.  They slipped a bunch of lines and situations past the British censors of the time.  The one I still think is the funniest is when the narrator is describing the little town.  He gets to a point where he says they are a simple people with simple pleasures.  And about 12 kids come running out the door to play. LOL.\n\n\nIMDB:\nBased on a true story. The name of the real ship, that sunk Feb 5 1941 - during WWII - was S/S Politician. Having left Liverpool two days earlier, heading for Jamaica, it sank outside Eriskay, The Outer Hebrides, Scotland, in bad weather, containing 250,000 bottles of whisky. The locals gathered as many bottles as they could, before the proper authorities arrived, and even today, bottles are found in the sand or in the sea every other year.
