Resolution of my version 720x 448 pixels, bitrate (variable bitrate selected) approx 906kbit/sec.\nParameters used: ABR 906 kbit/sec 720x448, crop 64 pixels left and right, Framerate unchanged, Audio AAC Gain 5dB, 128kbit/sec 48000hz, Stereo CBR, Brightness +8  Contrast +6, x264 deblock ON, lanczos scaling, Motion Estimation =Multi-Hexagon, CABAC ON, b-Frames ON 2-Pass Encoding ON\n\nIf you need PS3/Apple TX compatability you might need to switch off CABAC. \n(I Play mine on a Mac-Mini in the bedroom feeding a LCD TV 22\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; 1680x1050, so do not bother to make mine as compatable, but if you need to do this you can change the settings. \n\nThe Original from which I made this example was brought to you by hooghlyrocks, Thank you for your efforts. HOWEVER, I have to pay for bandwidth, so really would prefer to see rips like this one at 286 mB as costing less than a quarter the original torrent.  My Suggestion to Hooghly rocks, is, if he has the time to process the rip one more time, is: PLEASE upload 2 versions of each episode, one at your preferred 1000mB size, and another at 286mB size (or whatever, I know the size varies episode to episode) \nBUT perhaps, if hooghlyrocks critically looks at my rip, perhaps he might just do it \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;my way\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; (to quote Frank Sinatra) instead, and his own personal ripping time will be a lot less, (meaning he could upload more in the same time) the quality is pretty good (better I think than 95% of torrents) , and his rips will have their praises sung even more than they are already. \n\nTHINK: 22 episodes of a series done the way hooghlyrocks does them now will come to about 22-25gB\nBUT, done my way those 22 episodes would only be about 6.5-7.5gB and 99% of viewers on a 22\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; screen would really not enjoy it any less. \nHooghlyrocks uses a Mac same as I do, here is a challenge for him.
