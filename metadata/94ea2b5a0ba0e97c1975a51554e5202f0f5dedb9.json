Flush with his power, he charts a new course for the mob with the emphasis on a low profile approach exploiting quiet crime business like labour union control while promising to deal with murderous severity anyone he catches dealing with drugs. Yet for all the sureness of his position\\\\\\&amp;#039;s authority, his own indiscretions in his personal life provide complications of his own. With this being combined with the growing restiveness of his underling\\\\\\&amp;#039;s discomfort with his quiet approach and the FBI agents who are determined to bring him down, then the stage is set for a tragic fall.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94ea2b5a0ba0e97c1975a51554e5202f0f5dedb9","amp;dn":"The+Boss","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94ea2b5a0ba0e97c1975a51554e5202f0f5dedb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,234,43,90,11,160,233,124,25,117,165,21,84,229,32,47,15,93,237,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
