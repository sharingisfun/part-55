All the shows from February 2008 are included, along with a sprinkling of January&amp;#039;s.\n\nThe shows were recorded from DAB at 128 kbps MP2 on a Pure Bug Too onto SD card, then converted to mp3 and edited using Audacity to remove promos, travel and news where not relevant to the show.  I may have missed a promo or travel slot here or there, but generally there&amp;#039;s a reason that they&amp;#039;re included.\n\nAlong with Danny Baker, the shows also feature Baylen Leonard, Amy LamÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© and David Kuo  rotating as second presenter, and the show on 11th Feb has a very brief cameo of Liza Minelli on tape with Baylen Leonard (very brief, don&amp;#039;t say I didn&amp;#039;t warn you) recorded after she was in a studio being interviewed for another show.\n\nFans of the Candyman will not be disappointed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b42bc0ffda3289a4b0ad8ef5bb972dc689ff3f0","amp;dn":"Danny+Baker+BBC+London+Feb+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b42bc0ffda3289a4b0ad8ef5bb972dc689ff3f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,66,188,15,253,163,40,154,75,10,216,239,91,185,114,220,104,159,243,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
