Made iso so I could play with MagicDisc iso emulator.\r\nI've made no changes to it...no need to activate or register \r\n\r\nMy frustration is, it's 32 bit.  When running 64 like myself it does not let you install so you will need virtual pc or VMware and a copy of xp...still working on that for myself!\r\n\r\nGit it while you can, have great connection for the next 4 nights...\r\nAfter that, hit or miss!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5f1cc24f4378810b181fa49729967f844ab2877","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+-+Rebellion+iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5f1cc24f4378810b181fa49729967f844ab2877","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,241,204,36,244,55,136,16,177,129,250,73,114,153,103,248,68,171,40,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
