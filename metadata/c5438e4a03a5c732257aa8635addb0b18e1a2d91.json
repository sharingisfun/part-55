Yello - Claro Que Si\n\n\nTheir second and a more mature album, great album cover too.\nThey follow much the same imaginative style as their debut, but this time maybe even more like a motion picture, very visual indeed.\nJust listen to the wonderful and dramatic `She`s Got A Gun` and be in the middle of a French black and white movie from the 50`s...\nAtmospheric, full of witty lyrics and weird electronics, this is very innovative and playful tunes from the Swiss guys who brought us a number of wonderful albums. \n\n\n\n01.

Yello - One Second\n\n\nThe music is timeless. Each track is different, different style, different language. \nThere are great rhythms, some latin, some electronic, some heavy metal. Far from boring:the Latin flair of &quot;La Habanera&quot; and &quot;Call It Love&quot;; the French &quot;Le Secret Farida&quot;; the drum-happy &quot;Goldrush&quot;; the heavy metal-style love song &quot;Si Senor the Hairy Grill&quot;. &quot;The Rhythm Divine&quot;, which could be a perfect title for a James Bond movie; it&amp;#039;s sung by no less a Bond chanteuse than Shirley Bassey. \nI could go on and on.\n\n\n\n01.
