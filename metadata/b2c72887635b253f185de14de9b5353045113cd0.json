Reiner lets the idea bounce around the story&amp;#039;s setting and characters so that the full comic effect of the illicit relationship can be felt more chaotically, building on its own irony. Bette Midler and Dennis Farina are quite believable and likable as the not-so-estranged-anymore couple, and Paula Marshall is very good as their exasperated daughter. Not a masterpiece, but one of Reiner&amp;#039;s best films in years, with a distinctively European flavor to the comedy. The DVD release has a widescreen presentation.\n\nQuincyMKT\nGreat hard-to-find classic movies on bittorrent","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2c72887635b253f185de14de9b5353045113cd0","amp;dn":"That+Old+Feeling+%281997%29+%5BDVDRip%2C+Xvid%2C+1.85+WS%2C+Eng%5D+-+QuincyMKT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2c72887635b253f185de14de9b5353045113cd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,199,40,135,99,91,37,63,24,93,225,77,233,181,53,48,69,17,60,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
