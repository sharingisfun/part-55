The next and fifth record is entitled ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Continue To KillÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½.\nCo-produced by Dennis Ward (Angra / Pink Cream 69 / Krokus) and guest musicians such as Tom Naumann (ex-Primal Fear), Schmier (Destruction &amp; Headhunter) and Tomasz (ex-Belphegor), this record takes on a new slant.\nDebauchery was created in 2002. Since then the band has recorded and released: ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Kill, Maim, BurnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Rage Of The BloodbeastÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Torture PitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ and ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Back In BloodÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½, but whilst Rock Hard Magazine wrote that ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Torture PitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ was the best Death Metal album recorded by a German band in 2006, and the band were compared with Cannibal Corpse (speed), Benediction (groove) and Hypocrisy (hymns), no one could have prepared those critics for this release! \nIn 2003 Debauchery toured with Hate Plow and later with Napalm Death? In 2005 with Six Feet Under, in 2006 with Dismember, in 2007 Debauchery were on the road with Moonsorrow, but there?s much more to come, this lot will get around to you eventually","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:742c8990874b180afe854d6ead9d93b048d3bc1a","amp;dn":"Debauchery+-+Discography+%28working%29+www.metal-legions.com","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"742c8990874b180afe854d6ead9d93b048d3bc1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,44,137,144,135,75,24,10,254,133,77,110,173,157,147,176,72,211,188,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
