Girl Bartender \n&gt;\n&gt; Plot:\n&gt;\n&gt; For the past four years, San Francisco\n&gt; cop Jack Cates has been after an unidentified \n&gt; drug kingpin who calls himself the &quot;Ice Man&quot;. \n&gt; At the Hunter&amp;#039;s Point Raceway, Jack confronts\n&gt; Tyrone Burroughs and Arthur Brock. Jack kills Brock \n&gt; in self defense, but Burroughs escapes, and Jack is\n&gt; in danger of going to prison because Brock&amp;#039;s gun can\n&gt; t be found. Jack finds a picture that proves that the\n&gt; Ice Man has put a price on the head of Reggie Hammond,\n&gt; who is scheduled to be released from prison on the next day.\n&gt; Jack tries to convince Reggie to help him clear his name and\n&gt; find the Ice Man, but Reggie says he won&amp;#039;t help unless Jack \n&gt; gives Reggie the $500,000 that Jack has been holding on to for\n&gt; Reggie. Jack refuses to give Reggie the money unless Reggie\n&gt; helps him. After the bus that is transporting Reggie away\n&gt; from the prison is forced to crash by two bikers and Jack \n&gt; gets shot by the same two bikers, Jack forces Reggie to help\n&gt; him by having the hospital release Reggie into his custody.\n&gt; Reggie recognized one of the bikers as Richard &quot;Cherry&quot; Ganz,\n&gt; the brother of Albert Ganz, the escaped convict Jack killed\n&gt; years ago. Jack got shot because Cherry wants revenge for\n&gt; Albert&amp;#039;s death, and Cherry and his partner Willie Hickok are\n&gt; the hitmen who have been hired to kill Reggie. Burroughs, \n&gt; who works for the Ice Man, was trying to hire Brock as \n&gt; insurance, just in case Cherry and Hickok fail. Blake Wilson, \n&gt; the head of the Internal Affairs division, obviously doesn&amp;#039;t \n&gt; like Jack, because Wilson will stop at nothing to prosecute Jack \n&gt; for manslaughter in Brock&amp;#039;s death, and it turns out that the Ice Man \n&gt; put a price on Reggie&amp;#039;s head because Reggie knows who the Ice Man \n&gt; is someone Jack never expected it to be\n&gt;\n&gt; BE AWARE OF BOGUS SITES AND LAMERS\n&gt;\n&gt; DOWNLOAD YOUR DUQA FILES FROM DUQA ACCOUNTS\n&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/DUQA-TEAM/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/DUQA-TEAM/&lt;/a&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ENJOY!\n&gt;\n&gt; CLIP\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099044/trailers-screenplay-vi129433881&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099044/trailers-screenplay-vi129433881&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c27d80afe5458904e6ce2feb47724310d6f2cd52","amp;dn":"Another+48+Hrs.+%5B1990%5D.DVDR.XVID.%5BEng%5D-DUQA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c27d80afe5458904e6ce2feb47724310d6f2cd52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,125,128,175,229,69,137,4,230,206,47,235,71,114,67,16,214,242,205,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
