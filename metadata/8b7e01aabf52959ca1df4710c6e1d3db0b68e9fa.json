Enjoy!\nMike is back on vocals /,,/\n\n--\n\nBloodbath is finally back to put elite death metal on the map.\nThe brand new line-up is shortly to be officially revealed,\nbut has already paved way for a band hungrier than ever to\nbathe in the blood of a new recording.\nSo in early June, we?ll once again enter Fascination Street\nstudios (same place Nightmares Made Flesh was done) to cut\na couple of new songs. In good tradition, each member will\ncontribute to the writing with one song each.\nThe final result will be unleashed in the form of a mini-cd\nscheduled for release in late summer.\nThis affair will be self-financed and released only by Bloodbath\nin a limited edition. Info on how to obtain your copy will\nfollow with the announcement of the exact release date.\nSo stay tuned and get ready? because Bloodbath is back to DO-MI-NATE!\n\n--\n\nSo the time has come for Bloodbath to once again poison the\nscene with a contagious doze of ÃƒÂ¼ber brutal death metal.\nAn old acquaitance in this zombified bloodline has once\nagain re-visited his old home. We can now announce that\nthe vocalist on the new mini-cd is none other than\nMikael Ãƒâ€¦kerfeldt courtesy of Opeth.\n\nSecond deathster to join the elite is Mr Per ?Sodomizer? Eriksson\n(ex-21 Lucifers, ex-Genocrush Ferox). Sodomizer?s brutal\ndeath metal songwriting approach as well as guitar shredding\nis a highly welcomed element in the legacy of Bloodbath.\n\n--\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bloodbath.biz&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bloodbath.biz&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.snappermusic.com/Labels/Peaceville/Artists/Bloodbath/item11910?startPos&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.snappermusic.com/Labels/Peaceville/Artists/Bloodbath/item11910?startPos&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b7e01aabf52959ca1df4710c6e1d3db0b68e9fa","amp;dn":"Bloodbath-Unblessing_The_Purity-MCD-2008-COS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b7e01aabf52959ca1df4710c6e1d3db0b68e9fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,126,1,170,191,82,149,156,161,223,71,16,198,225,211,219,11,104,233,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
