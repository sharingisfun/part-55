WHEN HE LEFT THE SMITH&amp;#039;S FRIENDS MUCH LATER, HE PULLED THIS BOOK OUT OF DISTRIBUTION AND IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE NOW TO GET AN ORIGINAL COPY OF IT. THIS BOOK IS PROOF THAT HE THOROUGHLY BELIEVED THE DOCTRINE OF THE SMITH&amp;#039;S FRIENDS AND PRACTICED IT. THE BOOK IS DEDICATED TO SIGURD BRATLIE, ONE OF THE GREATEST CHRISTIAN LEADERS WHO EVER LIVED. ZAC POONEN CONSIDERED SIGURD BRATLIE HIS SPIRITUAL FATHER. LATER HE TURNED AGAINST BRATLIE AND BEGAN SLANDERING HIM IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE. THIS BOOK CITES SIGURD BRATLIE EXTENSIVELY. IT IS A BOOK THAT WILL BE OF USE TO THEOLOGIANS STUDYING THE SMITH&amp;#039;S FRIENDS MOVEMENT AND THE EXCLUSIVE CULTISH GROUP LED BY ZAC POONEN WHO BORROWED MOST OF ITS CENTRAL TEACHINGS FROM THE SMITH&amp;#039;S FRIENDS.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:556d8a21189709e02d147e93eac8c2bba90174ce","amp;dn":"RADIATING+HIS+GLORY_ZAC+POONEN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"556d8a21189709e02d147e93eac8c2bba90174ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,109,138,33,24,151,9,224,45,20,126,147,234,200,194,187,169,1,116,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
