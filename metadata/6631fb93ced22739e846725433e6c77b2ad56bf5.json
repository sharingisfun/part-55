The 1972 concert was originally supposed to only feature the Count Basie Orchestra and Ella Fitzgerald but Granz surprised everyone by inviting some \\&quot;guests\\&quot;: trumpeters Roy Eldridge and Harry \\&quot;Sweets\\&quot; Edison, the tenors of Stan Getz and Eddie \\&quot;Lockjaw\\&quot; Davis, pianist Oscar Peterson and bassist Ray Brown. Together with Basie-trombonist Al Grey they formed the Jazz at the Philharmonic All-Stars and play wonderfully on three jams (listen to Elridge\\&amp;#039;s break on \\&quot;In a Mellow Tone\\&quot;) and a ballad medley. In addition there are four selections from Basie\\&amp;#039;s band (featuring the tenor of Jimmy Forrest, trumpeter Pete Minger and altoist Curtis Peagler), a full set from Fitzgerald and a Peterson-Brown duet on \\&quot;You Are My Sunshine.\\&quot; The highpoint of the concert however is the final song, a classic version of \\&quot;C Jam Blues\\&quot; which finds Fitzgerald trading off in very humorous fashion with Grey, Getz, Sweets, Lockjaw and Eldridge; each of the encounters has at least one remarkable moment.\n\nPersonnel: Nelson Riddle, Count Basie Orchestra, Tommy Flanagan Trio ,Jazz at the Philharmonic All-Stars, Ray Brown, Eddie \\&quot;Lockjaw\\&quot; Davis, Eric Dixon,Harry \\&quot;Sweets\\&quot; Edison, Roy Eldridge, Ella Fitzgerald, Stan Getz, Freddie Green, Al Grey, Quincy Jones, Pete Minger, Oscar Peterson, Ed Thigpen\n\nDisc 1:\nCount Basie and his orchestra:\n1.
