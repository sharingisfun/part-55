The ship spins are similarly not available, but are supported in the\ncurrent development version of UQM (which will become the next release).&quot; END QUOTE\n\nUnfortunately, these videos are impossible to find in a form usable by UQM, you have to make them yourself.\n\nUntil now that is. :)\n\nNow, when you select the 3DO videos option in UQM, you will actually see a video:\n\nInstead of the normal (but very cool) slideshow:\n\nTo see the spins, go to Super Melee, highlight a ship, and hit the RIGHT ALT key.\nThis works in the game too I think.\n\nEnjoy your new videos!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a09499c49772e8195160ebc9a6104ed5c2a57805","amp;dn":"Ur-Quan+Masters+3DO+Videos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a09499c49772e8195160ebc9a6104ed5c2a57805","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,148,153,196,151,114,232,25,81,96,235,201,166,16,78,213,194,165,120,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
