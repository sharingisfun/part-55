This &amp;#039;soon-to-be-unfortunate&amp;#039; soul is Ann Darrow \n\n(Watts).

But Carl has another plan in mind\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n___________________________________\nTrivia:Jack Black has claimed that he did not wear any make-up at all in the entire movie \n\nafter hearing a false rumor that Clint Eastwood never wears any make-up in his movies. He \n\nalso wore a hairpiece during filming rather than going through makeup to achieve the &amp;#039;30s \n\nhairdo&amp;#039; look.\n\nThe Times Square set was built about 20% scaled down from the original. For this and most \n\nother New York sets, only the first story was built in full scale. The rest of the scenes \n\nwere added digitally. Streets were also extended using digital effects, and the number of \n\npedestrians and cars were doubled or even tripled in large scenes, using the same process \n\napplied to the battle scenes in the Lord of the Rings films.\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n______________________________________\n\nVideo info:   DivX 5 - 576x240 - 23.976fps - 3h 7mn 23s 98ms\n\nHash: CD2763E0D6BD4B659915C71232E4C92EE5C75C0C\n\nSize :1.36 GB\n\n\n\nTracker:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://open.tracker.thepiratebay.se/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://open.tracker.thepiratebay.se/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n       \t  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.se:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.se:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVisit us at :\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.genesis-sp.com/forum/index.php?&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.genesis-sp.com/forum/index.php?&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.torrentbox.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.torrentbox.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd2763e0d6bd4b659915c71232e4c92ee5c75c0c","amp;dn":"King+Kong","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd2763e0d6bd4b659915c71232e4c92ee5c75c0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,39,99,224,214,189,75,101,153,21,199,18,50,228,201,46,229,199,92,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
