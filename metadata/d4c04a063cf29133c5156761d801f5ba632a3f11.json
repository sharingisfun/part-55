Go to the castle closet to change.\n\nSome of the DLC relies on actual content being downloaded\nwhich isn&amp;#039;t already included in the game, as such that content\nisn&amp;#039;t loaded. This unlocks the content already there that does\nnot need extra files to use.\n\nAlso the dlc requires you to complete certain dungeons to\nunlock the extra buildings etc. Check the dlc info ingame\nin the download area, or some faq for info on which to do.\n\nNote: Works on PAL if you use freethewads on it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4c04a063cf29133c5156761d801f5ba632a3f11","amp;dn":"Final.Fantasy.MLaaK.NTSC.Wiiware.DLC.Unlocked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4c04a063cf29133c5156761d801f5ba632a3f11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,192,74,6,60,242,145,51,197,21,103,97,216,1,245,186,99,42,63,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
