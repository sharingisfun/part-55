Ai tempi reggae, debitamente velocizzati, ÃƒÂ¨ stata aggiunta una maggiore cura per le basse frequenze, oltre ad un uso smodato di sintetizzatori analogici e beat elettronici. ?Homegrown fantasy? (1995) ÃƒÂ¨ l?album piÃƒÂ¹ venduto degli Zion Train (circa 20.000 copie in U.K.) e rappresenta un punto cardinale all?interno dell?universo roots. Brani come ?Dance of life?, ?Free the bass? o ?Universal communication? si piazzano dritti dritti al primo posto, e non sono da meno le movimentatissime sezioni ritmiche di ?The healing of the nation? e ?Venceremos?. PiÃƒÂ¹ lente, forse prevedendo lo sviluppo easy listening del dub, le altre ?Love the Earth?, ?Live good IV?, ?Get ready? o ?Why should we have to fight??. Le tematiche sociali scompaiono, almeno a parole, ma l?intento dance e l?innovazione stilistica restano in piedi. Gli Zion Train, con una discografia oceanica, sono tra i migliori remixer dub che si possano trovare sul mercato. Esperienza, saggezza, talento infiniti. (tratto da qoob.tv)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur biggest selling album (about 20,000) and the one that brought us to most people&amp;#039;s attention. It was also the first one for China Records which did upset a lot of fans as we were perceived as an &amp;#039;independent&amp;#039; group at the time.\n\nJust prior to this LP there had been a fashionable rush on &amp;#039;Dub&amp;#039; and many labels were signing anything remotely &amp;#039;Dub&amp;#039;. We were interested in investigating the world of major labels and we developed a good rapport with China and head honcho Derek Green in particular.\n\nThis was our only LP to get a full US release. The Americans hated Zion Train, one review of the LP aped Spinal Tap, it ran &amp;#039;Homegrown Fantasy, Homegrown Shit&amp;#039;.\n\nFor legal reasons we are not permitted to discuss the details of our contract with China but we have no regrets. The advance we received helped us to buy the equipment which finally established our studio as a professional sounding facility and the exposure we got led to us making the first ever Dub video, touring the US, releasing a CD-Rom alongside this LP and, on the CD-ROM, to distribute a massive Anarchist library at Warner Bros. expense. We had a laugh and made some of the best music we ever had.\n\nThe track titles on the CD are intended to form twp sentences. Venceremos is a Spanish term meaning &amp;#039;We will win&amp;#039;, this was a nod to the Working Week song of the same name sung by Tracy Thorn and Robert Wyatt.\n\nUltimately our sales figures weren&amp;#039;t satisfactory for the big boys and we settled back into our own regime but if you ever get the chance to be signed by a&amp;#039; major&amp;#039; label take it, keep your eyes open and enjoy yourself as much as you can.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nplease seed and enjoy us @","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8040af70a22a8fff3f50a7abe086a745c8b71454","amp;dn":"%28Colombo+Electronic%29Zion+Train+-+1995+-+Homegrown+Fantasy+%5Bwma+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8040af70a22a8fff3f50a7abe086a745c8b71454","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,64,175,112,162,42,143,255,63,80,167,171,224,134,167,69,200,183,20,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
