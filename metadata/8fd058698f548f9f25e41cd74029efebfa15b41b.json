The idea is to rethink the menu \nto integrate KDE applications \ninto fluxbox, and to better utilize the fluxbox\nmenu&amp;#039;s potential to do things other than open up applications.\nIt turns out that Fluxbox and Konqueror are a match made in\ndesktop heaven.  Kickbox uses Konqueror  to navigate the system\nto generate graphical menus, to mount storage media, and \nview documents.\n\nKIckbox also adds built-in editing templates to the \nconfiguration files, and includes a variety of  shortcuts\nto provide fast, easy access to those files for editing. \nMaking fluxbox your own was never easier.\n\nFinally, the most important part of this project may be\nthe documentation that is underway at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutkickbox.blogspot.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutkickbox.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCONTENTS:\nWhat you have here is a set of elaborately rewritten\nconfiguration files for Fluxbox, nothing more,\nnothing less.  \n\nOkay, that&amp;#039;s not strictly true.  Also included are a\ncouple dozen backgrounds which are set up to open at\nrandom each time Kickbox restarts.  I added several more\nbackgrounds to this edition, being less convinced that \n&quot;yellow jacket&quot; my original theme for kickbox 0.01, is not\nas ugly as original sin.  I removed several of my original \nwallpapers, and added some others that appear to gpl&amp;#039;d,\nincluding some default KDE wallpapers.  So my crazy\nwallpapers won&amp;#039;t come up so much.\n\nIn order for these to work effectively\non your system as written, the following must be installed:\n\nFluxbox\nKDE 3\nfirefox\nand you may need feh (an image viewer) in order for the\nbackgrounds to display to best effect (Alternately, you\nmay be able to use another image viewer, and fix the files\naccordingly.)\n\nThe current version of these files has been tested on Ubuntu 8.04,\n and on Vector Linux SoHo 5.8, but I&amp;#039;ve been working on these files for about \ntwo to three years, and I&amp;#039;ve used earlier versions with Slackware,\n openSUSE, and Debian (stable and unstable).\n\nblackbox_jones\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;f4809c918395979f8d909b97809b86b49399959d98da979b99&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nfor more information, go to &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutkickbox.blogspot.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutkickbox.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nKickbox is released under the GPL, and comes with no\nwarranty, to the extent permitted by applicable law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fd058698f548f9f25e41cd74029efebfa15b41b","amp;dn":"Kickbox+0.02+Window+Manager+for+Linux","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fd058698f548f9f25e41cd74029efebfa15b41b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,208,88,105,143,84,143,159,37,228,28,215,64,41,239,235,250,21,180,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
