This program just makes sense!?\n\nDavid Dickerson, Quest3D user\n\nWorking with Quest3D is a very creative way to develop projects. The real-time nature of the program means you are directly working on your end result. You have loads of room try out new concepts and realize the concept you have in your head.\n\nMany high-end software can be too complex for commercial applications. Simpler tools can?t cope with the rendering power and complexity of real world applications. Quest3D delivers best of both worlds. It is packed with all the powerful features you need, renders with amazing performance and still offers an easy user interface.\n\nQuest3DÃ‚Â® Power Edition can handle big projects with ease. You have full control over placing of logic or data. A project can be split up in as many files as you want so each developer can work on his own section of the project.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8bca1b9ae67b889213e7957e266ac7a1cf44dde","amp;dn":"Quest3D+v3.6+VR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8bca1b9ae67b889213e7957e266ac7a1cf44dde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,188,161,185,174,103,184,137,33,62,121,87,226,102,172,122,28,244,77,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
