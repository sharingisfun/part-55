I do like the recording, also - a fine job of digitizing the 1st-gen reels to DVD-Audio by Presence, it left me nothing to do but downsample to Audio CD and track up.  \n\nThis show really is everything you&amp;#039;ve ever heard it was.  One thing I do feel like staying awake to note is that everyone should re-engineer a show at least once - you end up listening between songs a lot and you hear things that you might not have heard otherwise - an example of this is a female fan who cries out in recognition of a new track off &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; at the first note - like she had been waiting forever to hear &quot;In My Time Of Dying.&quot;  \n\nShare and enjoy.
