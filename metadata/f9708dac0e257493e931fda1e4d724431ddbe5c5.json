In Suffolk, they moor in Shotley marina, the site of the former naval training camp HMS Ganges. From here they venture into the Walton backwaters and then out into the North Sea for a trip to Brightlingsea, Essex. Chatham in Kent is the port were the Spalls spent months learning the art of navigation before venturing out into the sea for the first time all those years ago. Tim hadn't realised how much the waters of the Medway would change in the blackness of night - after hours at sea they are close to land, but become lost. After much fretting, Tim reluctantly calls the coastguard. The lifeboat crew take them to the nearest port, Queenborough in Sheppey. The next day they safely make it to Chatham, where both Tim and Shane are drained and relieved. The final journey up the Thames into London is where he eventually realises why he did this adventure in the first place.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/ba/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7a/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ac/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/32/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f0/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a1/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0b/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fd/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/15/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/81/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3c/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ea/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  HD Version \r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~3178Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.50 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 29 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 4\r\n * Part Size: ~700 MB (average)\r\n * Source: HDTV (upscaled)\r\n * Encoded by: JungleBoy\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01cmbc8","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9708dac0e257493e931fda1e4d724431ddbe5c5","amp;dn":"BBC+Timothy+Spall+All+at+Sea+4of4+The+Last+Splash+720p+x264+AAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9708dac0e257493e931fda1e4d724431ddbe5c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,112,141,172,14,37,116,147,233,49,253,161,228,215,36,67,29,219,229,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
