Although a more diverse album, Semi-Detached is comparable to previous effort &amp;#039;Troublegum&amp;#039;, seeing the expanded line-up (with new drummer Graham Hopkins and guitarist/ cellist) return to the hard-edged, yet melodic rock music of their breakthrough album. Every song offers something new, with standout tracks &amp;#039;Tightrope walker&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;Tramline&amp;#039;, almost unlistenable in parts,moreG?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âª quite brilliant. Singles &amp;#039;Church of noise&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;Lonely cryin&amp;#039; only&amp;#039;, two of the &amp;#039;popier&amp;#039; songs in the running order boast great sing-along choruses, although they are not the best tracks on the record by any means, being overshadowed by the less radio-friendly &amp;#039;Black eye purple sky&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Safe&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;Born too soon&amp;#039;. With the emotional &amp;#039;The Boy&amp;#039;s asleep&amp;#039; concluding proceedings, listeners will be left reaching for the repeat button.\n\nEnjoy! :)\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfc0e30707efa1ab4c51783e0a50e2a1095e724c","amp;dn":"Therapy+-+Semi-Detached","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfc0e30707efa1ab4c51783e0a50e2a1095e724c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,192,227,7,7,239,161,171,76,81,120,62,10,80,226,161,9,94,114,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
