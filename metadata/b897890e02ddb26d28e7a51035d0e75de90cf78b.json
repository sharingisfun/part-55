He takes delivery of a 1970 Dodge Challenger to take from Colorado to Frisco, California. Shortly after pickup, he takes a bet to get the car there in less than 15 hours. After a few run-ins with motorcycle cops and highway patrol they start a chase to bring him into custody. Along the way, Kowalski is guided by Supersoul - a blind DJ with a police radio scanner. Throw in lots of chase scenes, gay hitchhikers, a naked woman riding a motorbike, lots of Mopar and you\\\\\\&amp;#039;ve got a great cult hit from the early 70\\\\\\&amp;#039;s\n\nvideo format...mpeg2  ntsc  16:9  720x480\nplaytime...1:45:42\nenglish dolby  ac-3/2\nenglish/spanish subtitles\ndvd-5\nincludes title and menu\\\\\\&amp;#039;s","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b897890e02ddb26d28e7a51035d0e75de90cf78b","amp;dn":"Vanishing+Point--1971--DVDR--WS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b897890e02ddb26d28e7a51035d0e75de90cf78b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,151,137,14,2,221,178,109,40,231,165,16,53,208,231,93,233,12,247,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
