It contains the short films Gwar must be destroyed and Return of Techno Destructo (both are from the Dim Times), the Surf of Syn video and some rare footage from the Slave Revolt tour. The footage is tied together as flashbacks told while Techno is beaten up by Tarantulina.\n\nThis movie was originally called as \\&quot;My name is Hunter Jackson and really I\\&amp;#039;m the brains behind Gwar\\&quot; but it was retitled right before the release.\n\nThis is an old VHS dub ripped to a dvd recorder. Quality isn\\&amp;#039;t exactly HD but you get what you pay for.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:403eaca5c14b54a9e58b350d3ff64457c952cff9","amp;dn":"Gwar+Return+of+Techno+Destructo+VHS+rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"403eaca5c14b54a9e58b350d3ff64457c952cff9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,62,172,165,193,75,84,169,229,139,53,13,63,246,68,87,201,82,207,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
