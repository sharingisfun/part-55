Have your mind ever crossed the thought of creating your own heroÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦well, letÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s go further - your own heroes team which would fight battles for you in the 3D virtual world in the exactly way youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½d imagined? Have you dreamed of testing your programming skills in something more cute than bureau software application or webpage? Or perhaps youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ve just wanted to learn how to program? If you answered ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½yesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ for at least one of these questions, then this game is no doubt for you!\n\nThe game seems to be a bit weird at the beginning, when compared to other contemporary games. You have to create your own warriors. You can choose between magician, barbarian, monk, ranger woman (archer woman, forest guard). We plan to enhance the number of choices in the near future. Each of these characters has its own, unique skills and features - you can find more information on this topic in the instruction. Each warrior has personal characteristics (as in the most games); you can form the warrior, its skills and effectiveness by giving points to the selected features.\n\nBeside deciding about the characteristics of a Scriptarian you need to program it. The program is responsible for the behaviour of the hero during the battle, its coordination, who and how it is going to attack, whom it can speak with. As itÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s been said in the beginning, Scriptarian programs are written in Scriptarin. This language has been specially designed for FRS and Artifex Mundi purposes.\nWhen all of the heroes and programs are ready, choose the members of your team, load them to the program, do the same with the opponent team, decide on which terrain the battle is going to take place andÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦watch how your effects of work, projects, planning and programming are doing in the semi real fight.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:014d4f8e53a67f0a909a01a646984e99213b70c0","amp;dn":"The.Scriptarians.The.Tournament-SKIDROW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"014d4f8e53a67f0a909a01a646984e99213b70c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,77,79,142,83,166,127,10,144,154,1,166,70,152,78,153,33,59,112,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
