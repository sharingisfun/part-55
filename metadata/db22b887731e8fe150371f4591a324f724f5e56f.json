Leo and I focusing on the following \n\ntopics:\n\n-the continuing skeptical reception of Leo at ConCen;\n\n-Leo&amp;#039;s current family crisis in Norway and how Leo&amp;#039;s mother Jessica Lyon Zagami and his aunt the lawyer \n\nFelicity Carnegie are applying legal pressure on the Suslu family (the family of Leo&amp;#039;s wife) and the \n\nGulen Movement to be able to arrive at some acceptable solution in which Leo will be able to see his now \n\nkidnapped son; \n\n-How the Turkish Mafia Suslu family avoids paying taxes for their 5 or 6 shops in Oslo to finance their \n\nMuslim Gulen school;\n\n-How Leo still is not too fond of the Prime Minister of Norway, Jens Stoltenberg;\n\n-We embark again on the consequences of the pending crash in September;\n\nHalfway through Leo decides to call up Eric Jon Phelps with Leo explaining to Eric that he intentions \n\nare genuinely good and anti-Vatican. While I&amp;#039;m being a tacit witness, the following matters are \n\ndiscussed between the two gentlemen:\n\n-The desire to have a present masonic schism needed to oppose the powers of the Vatican such as what \n\nhappened in the past with previous masonic schisms; \n\n-Leo&amp;#039;s current family crisis in Norway;\n\n-How Italy should be freed from the influence of the Vatican; the Garibaldi mission;\n\n-Cagliostro one of Leo&amp;#039;s ancestors, grandmaster of the real Illuminati who opposed the Jesuitical \n\nabomination put forward through the likes of Adam Weishaupt; \n\n-How the Priory of Zion is, and has always been, inimical to the Vatican;\n\n-How Islam is completely allied with the Vatican;\n\n-Both settle on authoring and making public of an anti-Vatican/anti-Jesuit Masonic Manifesto, which Leo \n\npromises to read out loud in the Monte Carlo Lodge this summer;\n\n-The possible future race-war in America;\n\n-The pending nominations of generals among the US Militia by Leo;\n\n-That Leo regrets his hardship with Greg Szymanski;\n\n-Silvio Berlusconi seemingly turning away from the Vatican upon his realizing that the latter is \n\ndestroying his country;\n\n-Mussolini the great betrayer of traditional Italian fascism;\n\n--------------------------\nReferences:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.leozagami.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.leozagami.com/&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://studimonetari.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://studimonetari.org/&lt;/a&gt; (Saba&amp;#039;s site)\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://vaticanassassins.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://vaticanassassins.org/&lt;/a&gt; (Phelps&amp;#039; site)\t\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.google.com/search?q=leo+lyon+zagami&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.google.com/search?q=leo+lyon+zagami&lt;/a&gt;\n--------------------------\n\nTech specs:\n\nMPEG-1 layer 3 (mp3)\n64kbit\n48000Hz Mono\n\nDuration:\nPART 1: 53m16s\nPART 2: 68m31s\n\nDirect downloads:\nPART 1: http://www.mediafire.com/?zmmwmmz12jp\nPART 2: http://www.mediafire.com/?2eve21b9x2n\n\n===============================================================================\nOur leaders lie, cheat, steal and kill with virtual impunity.
