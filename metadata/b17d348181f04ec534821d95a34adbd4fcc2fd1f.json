Dortmund Soundgarden, Germany, June 2001\n\nFront, Back And CD Cover Included.\n\n\nTherapy?&amp;#039;s sixth studio album, Shameless, is a rather sophisticated proposition. Where the Therapy?&amp;#039;s retrospective So Much For The Ten Year Plan was the epitome of heads-down rock--chugging guitars and hoarse vocals, driven by a raw energy that made up for the fact that it sounded like it had been recorded in a basement--their sixth studio album is, well, different. First single &quot;Gimme Back My Brain&quot; and the sinister &quot;Stalk &amp; Slash&quot; once again attack with thundering drums and Andy Cairns&amp;#039; blood-curdling bark, but with the likes of &quot;Dance&quot;, &quot;I Am The Money&quot; and &quot;Alrite&quot; playing up their Nine Inch Nails ambitions, they&amp;#039;ve remerged as a world-class metal outfit, &quot;nu&quot; or otherwise. It&amp;#039;s a menacing makeover; fantastically clinical production adding an unnerving does of grime and attitude, which makes the otherwise glam-rock pop of &quot;Body Bag Girl&quot; something Marilyn Manson with be proud of. 21st-century sleaze is one obvious plus; the other is that Shameless is their most balanced album to date. To the raw aggression, and murky production, add the best hooks, riffs and songs of their career, which prove anything America&amp;#039;s multi-million dollar anti-heroes can do, little old Therapy? can do better. \n\nI am going to try and include the covers in my torrents from now on. Sorry to anyone who got some of my earlier ones without the covers but Im sure you know theres loads of places out there you can grab &amp;#039;em and if not &amp;#039;JUST GOOGLE IT!&amp;#039;\n\nEnjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b17d348181f04ec534821d95a34adbd4fcc2fd1f","amp;dn":"Therapy+-+Shameless","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b17d348181f04ec534821d95a34adbd4fcc2fd1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,125,52,129,129,240,78,197,52,130,29,149,163,74,219,212,252,194,253,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
