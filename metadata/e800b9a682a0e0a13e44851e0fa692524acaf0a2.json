Dean, guitarist Jay Crawford, and drummer Tony Fag (Anthony Paul Short, A.K.A. Blind Tony Fag). Their first show was July 4, 1986, opening for Flipper. Bomb&amp;#039;s sound was deep, hard rock with melodic guitars, relentless tribal drumming (reviews referred to Fag as &quot;The Human Drum Machine&quot;), strong pop singing, and sometimes-cryptic lyrics. Common subjects of the songs were death, sex, drugs, girls, boys, love, loss, Satan, God, cross-dressing, girls, suicide, hope and girls.&quot; \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e800b9a682a0e0a13e44851e0fa692524acaf0a2","amp;dn":"107+MICHAEL+W.+DEAN+SONGS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e800b9a682a0e0a13e44851e0fa692524acaf0a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,0,185,166,130,160,224,161,62,68,133,30,15,166,146,82,74,202,240,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
