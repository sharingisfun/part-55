The club was in the heart of Sharm - the hip cosmopolitan resort town with a st. Tropez ambiance.\n\nWhen bus stop expanded and became the first venue in Egypt to start weekly open-air parties with up to 30,000 partygoers, DJ Ouzo\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s career also expanded, and he was soon DJ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;ing alongside some of the top international names, and played for the Echo Temple at the berlin love parade.\n\n2004 saw another huge leap forward when bus stop became the first ever PACHA in the middle east and Africa. DJ Ouzo was the natural choice for the premiere residency. He continued to go upwards and onwards and has now started to tour playing in Dubai and now he is playing in Canada and the Dominican Republic.\n\nHe has a diverse style, mixing uplifting funky house with recently more of a progressive edge. however he is adament that it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;the crowd, music, the place\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; which makes the night, and explains that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;I actually create the mood depending on the people\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;.\n\nOuzo has had the opportunity to mix along side international DJ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s such as Simon &amp; Shaker, Wally Lopez, Pete Tong, David Guetta, Sarah Sanchez, David Morilles and Axwell. He has considerable talent and is definetly one tp watch.\n\n\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d09e841fce77e0f2ff57a8e7f089cde61f72e85","amp;dn":"WINTER+SESSIONS+2008+-+PACHA+-+MIXED+BY+DJ+OUZO+%28httpwww.mytholo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d09e841fce77e0f2ff57a8e7f089cde61f72e85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,9,232,65,252,231,126,15,47,245,122,142,127,8,156,222,97,247,46,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
