The town is dirty and chaotic. Computer games have lost their innocence: they are addictive and large sums of money can be won. Ash lives alone. She doesn&amp;#039;t have any contact with other people, only with her dog. Her only activities are cooking meals for the dog and playing games. She is a professional Avalon super warrior, a player on the top-level, that is only accessible under very specific conditions. Once a player is inside, they can only stop by winning the game. Otherwise the player can die. Ash ignores all warnings and decides to play anyway. \n\nDirector:        Mamoru Oshii\n\nCountry:         Japan | Poland \n\nTransfer Format: 1080P\n\nYear:            2001\n\nRunning Time:    106 mins 40 seconds\n\nIMDB:           &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0267287/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0267287/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFinalcodec Player \n\ndownload                                                                       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.siluhd.com/soft/FinalCodecs2008sp.exe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.siluhd.com/soft/FinalCodecs2008sp.exe&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou need a powerfull computer to play AVC codec HD\nRecommended: INTEL Core2 DUO or AMD X2 4800+ and ATI 2400 PRO\n\n\nOther movies visit                                                                          \n\n                 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/accpt7506_siluer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/accpt7506_siluer&lt;/a&gt;\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebc6d776c9615b88e39ec1964483212388a26bb4","amp;dn":"Avalon.2001.Blu-ray.H264.1080p.TRUEHD.DDEX51.%40SiluHD.COM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebc6d776c9615b88e39ec1964483212388a26bb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,198,215,118,201,97,91,136,227,158,193,150,68,131,33,35,136,162,107,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
