I try to make an image out of a not so good night shot by Stuart Martin from New Zealand. Stuart had his camera for three days and was experimenting with it. He shot the Christmas decora- tion of his neigh- bour but only got a dark and a bit blurry image.\n\nWith no specific goal in mind I just played around with UFRaw and layers in GIMP and got a quite nice result. The 100% crop you see here is a bit like a painting, the full image looks like seen through night vision goggles. The lesson to learn except a refresh of using UFRaw and layers: Play around! Make experiments! There is no right way - just interesting results.\n\nStuart has an incredible collection of links to sites about language - from fun to pure science.\n\nDon?t forget the challenge! Make a monochrome image and post it in our meetthegimp.org photogroup at 23 and be sure to use the tag ?mtg-monochrome?. The challenge ends March 31 1600GMT and I?ll draw a winner by random choice.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73f409865f906fe201f59476a422250acb9295ae","amp;dn":"Meet_the_Gimp_Videopodcast_Episode_036_Nightvision","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73f409865f906fe201f59476a422250acb9295ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,244,9,134,95,144,111,226,1,245,148,118,164,34,37,10,203,146,149,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
