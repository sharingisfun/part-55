When I don&amp;#039;t have the case sleeve I use Memorex&amp;#039;s free label design software to create my own and I print the DVD face and the BIO on the front of the sleeve and print the title on the spine. I even use colored paper to make a colorfull collection.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:408fa433baac25c885ff8786fbfe703301396796","amp;dn":"DVD_Label_Cover_Art_V.2.1%28Additions_Only-No_Repeats%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"408fa433baac25c885ff8786fbfe703301396796","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,143,164,51,186,172,37,200,133,255,135,134,251,254,112,51,1,57,103,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
