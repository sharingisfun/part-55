You can forget your Great Wall of China, that landing thing on the moon or even the first time man managed flight, all of them even collectively pale into insignificance when compared to the first time cartoons graced our lives. Whether you agree with this statement or not you would have to admit that over the years that cartoons have been aired on TV or the animations experienced at the cinema they have had a profound influence on the young and young at heart. Some of my happiest TV memories are of the early morning cartoons before school or at the weekends, but what I see on the TV these days are in my opinion shadows of their forbears. One of the worst cartoon creations I have witnessed though has been in the game that I have just finished playing, The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius vs. Jimmy Negatron. \n\nHave Fun!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38fef1c4ff4923fc5af499e6d21427bfecb3576f","amp;dn":"The+Adventures+of+Jimmy+Neutron+Boy+Genius+VS+Jimmy+Negatron","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38fef1c4ff4923fc5af499e6d21427bfecb3576f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,254,241,196,255,73,35,252,90,244,153,230,210,20,39,191,236,179,87,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
