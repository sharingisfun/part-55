It premiered in 1991 on MTV\\&amp;#039;s Liquid Television experimental animation show as a six-part serial of short films, followed in 1992 by five individual short episodes. In 1995 a season of ten half-hour episodes aired as a stand-alone series.\n\nAeon Flux was created by Korean American animator Peter Chung (also the man behind Phantom 2040, which used the same animation style as Aeon Flux). A live action motion picture loosely based upon the series and starring Charlize Theron was released in late 2005.\t\n\nCOMPRESSED INTO DVD5 FORMAT","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ffd3761b5cbdbd8fbcfe165a5073759cd10a459","amp;dn":"Aeon+Flux+%28Animated%29+M-TV%5C%27s+3+Disc+Set+DVD5%2C+ENG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ffd3761b5cbdbd8fbcfe165a5073759cd10a459","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,253,55,97,181,203,219,216,251,207,225,101,165,7,55,89,205,16,164,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
