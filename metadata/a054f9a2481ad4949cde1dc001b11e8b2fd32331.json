It was a labor of love to record\nthese songs that influenced me so many years ago. It was important for me to\nkeep the arrangements true to the original in the hope that when people listen\nto this it recreates the magic I experienced when hearing these songs on the\nradio the first time round.&quot; - George Canyon\n\nwww.georgecanyon.com\n\ngeorge canyon covers classics by the likes of johnny cash merle haggard and more\ngreat country stars.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a054f9a2481ad4949cde1dc001b11e8b2fd32331","amp;dn":"George+Canyon-Classics+%282007-VBR-Country%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a054f9a2481ad4949cde1dc001b11e8b2fd32331","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,84,249,162,72,26,212,148,156,222,29,192,1,177,30,139,47,211,35,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
