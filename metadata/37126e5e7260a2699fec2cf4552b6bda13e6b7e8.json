Malingering somewhere between the political and the comic, the punky, the poppy and the metallic, they&amp;#039;ve spent 15 years purposefully avoiding categorisation. If only there were more bands with that kind of courage. So, High Anxiety is a welcome return after two painful years without a drummer or a record deal. True to form, they&amp;#039;ve recruited a sticksman from the very top drawer. Where 2001&amp;#039;s Shameless employed Barrett Martin, the powerhouse behind Screaming Trees, High Anxiety features Neil Cooper from the criminally ignored the Beyond. The effect is immediate, Cooper adding a vital edge and energy to a set of songs that, for the most part, would not make it onto any Therapy? hits package. Highlights are the opening, rumbling and humorously blasphemous &quot;Hey Satan--You Rock&quot;, the bitter and menacing &quot;Not in Any Name&quot;, the epic, howling closer &quot;Rust&quot; and &quot;Limbo&quot; which knowingly quotes from the Beyond&amp;#039;s &quot;Eve of My Release&quot;. Also excellent is the hidden track &quot;Never Ending&quot;, a despairing pop metal that really should be on the CD proper (you can find it after seven minutes of &quot;Rust&quot;). Fans will find much to enjoy here.\n\n\nI am sorry about the last attempt at this torrent, I don&amp;#039;t know what happened. I seeded it to half a dozen people fine and then left but unfortunately they all buggered of without seeding anymore and when i tried to re-seed it kept saying I only had 99.6% so I am starting again apologies. \n\nEnjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37126e5e7260a2699fec2cf4552b6bda13e6b7e8","amp;dn":"Therapy%3F+-+High+Anxiety","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37126e5e7260a2699fec2cf4552b6bda13e6b7e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,18,110,94,114,96,162,105,159,236,44,244,85,43,107,218,19,230,183,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
