The album was released on September 11, 2007 in the US, and September 17, 2007 in the UK. Initial pressings of the album come with the bonus track &quot;Old Man,&quot; a Neil Young cover, and an enhanced video of &quot;By the Time I Get Home There Won&amp;#039;t Be Much of a Place for Me.&quot;\n\nThe album takes on a darker tone than their debut Kicking the National Habit from 2004. Billboard Magazine described the album as &quot;an indie rocker&amp;#039;s idea of Saturday Night Fever,&quot; and Stylus Magazine described the song &quot;Joker and Clown&quot; as &quot;one of 2007&amp;#039;s best ballads.&quot;\n\nThe title of the album is a lyric taken from the hit song &quot;She&amp;#039;s Gone&quot; by Hall and Oates.[1]\n\n[edit] Track listing\n\n   1. &quot;Reason to Hide In&quot; - 4:35\n   2. &quot;Weird Ideas at Work&quot; - 5:00\n   3. &quot;Animal Sounds&quot; - 4:35\n   4. &quot;By the Time I Get Home There Won&amp;#039;t Be Much of a Place for Me&quot; - 4:00\n   5. &quot;Cut by the Brakes&quot; - 4:36\n          * contains a sample of &quot;Mit Dir&quot; by Robert GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rl\n   6. &quot;Tongue&quot; - 6:37\n   7. &quot;Going to Switch the Lights On&quot; - 4:37\n   8. &quot;New Space to Throw&quot; - 3:52\n   9. &quot;Joker and Clown&quot; - 3:36\n  10. &quot;Close Approximation&quot; - 4:22\n  11. &quot;Pieces Pieces&quot; [vinyl &amp; Japanese edition CD only bonus track]\n  12. &quot;Pack All the Things You Need&quot; - 2:46\n  13. &quot;Part of a Corner&quot; - 4:07\n  14. &quot;Old Man&quot; (bonus track) - 3:36\n  15. &quot;By the Time I Get Home There Won&amp;#039;t Be Much of a Place for Me&quot; (enhanced video)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a566e2bd18980a92750e30c00cab0304169ba013","amp;dn":"Grand+National+-+A+Drink+And+A+Quick+Decision","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a566e2bd18980a92750e30c00cab0304169ba013","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,102,226,189,24,152,10,146,117,14,48,192,12,171,3,4,22,155,160,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
