The \nCIA&amp;#039;s brilliant young analyst, Jack Ryan, thinks he knows the reason for the \nsudden Red Fleet operation: the Soviets&amp;#039; most valuable ship, the Red \nOctober, is attempting to defect to the United States.\n\nThe new ballistic-missile submarine&amp;#039;s defection is high treason on an \nunprecedented scale and nearly the entire Soviet Atlantic Fleet has been \nordered to find and destroy her at all costs. If the U.S. fleet can locate her \nfirst and get her safely to port, it will be the intelligence coup of all time.\n\nThe nerve-wracking hunt goes on for eighteen days as the Red October tries \nto elude her hunters across 4000 miles of ocean. The rousing climax is one of \nthe most thrilling underwater scenes ever written.\n\n----\n\nRead by J. Charles\n\n----\n\nJ.
