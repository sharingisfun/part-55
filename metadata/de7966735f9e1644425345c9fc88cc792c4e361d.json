It is notable because, unlike in the vast majority of fantasy novels, the world evolves over the ages, going from a bronze-age barter economy to a more traditional high fantasy setting over the course of the work.\n\nIt primarily concerns Althalus, a professional thief enlisted by the Goddess Dweia to save the world from the depredations of her evil brother Daeva and his henchman Ghend. As with other Eddings books, it is written in a style which combines dramatic storytelling with plenty of wry humour and light relief.\n\n\nHere you will find an audiobook, e-book in PDF format &amp; boo coversw from different edditions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de7966735f9e1644425345c9fc88cc792c4e361d","amp;dn":"David+%26+Leigh+Eddings++-+The+Redemption+of+Althalus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de7966735f9e1644425345c9fc88cc792c4e361d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,121,102,115,95,158,22,68,66,83,69,201,252,136,204,121,44,78,54,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
