When Jonas catches a glimpse of an eel-like alien life form disappearing through a concrete wall of the gateroom, Hammond orders a security lockdown of the base. However, the alert is lifted when no trace of the creature can be detected. Unfazed, OÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Neill heads off on a fishing trip while Jonas and Carter stay behind to examine the artifact. As they work, Jonas sees an alien slither across his arm, but Carter doesnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t see the alien and Jonas starts to wonder if heÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s losing his mind. Meanwhile, OÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Neill is chatting with a rural gas station owner named Vernon Sharpe when an eel-like alien flies past his head. Sharpe, however, sees nothing unusual. Back at SGC, Carter determines that the creatures exist in a parallel dimension and can only be seen by people who have been exposed to the artifactÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s energy. When Carter realizes that the device gives off an electrical charge that can be passed from person to person, OÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Neill has to retrace his steps and warn everyone he has contacted. A paranoid and Gulf War veteran, Sharpe starts seeing creatures before OÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Neill can get to him. Afraid the government is after him, Sharpe goes AWOL, undermining SG-1ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s efforts to contain the disease. Carter and Jonas, meanwhile, create a cure by reversing the deviceÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s energy field. SG-1 deduces that Sharpe headed for a friendÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s place in Las Vegas. OÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Neill chases him through the airport and into a hangar and talks the psychologically damaged veteran into keeping the whole episode a secret. \n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEpisode 14 - Smoke And Mirrors\n\nOriginal air date: January 24, 2003 \nWhen Sen. Kinsey is assassinated in broad daylight in front of a dozen civilian witnesses, Col. Jack O\\&amp;#039;Neill is the prime suspect, having been seen and videotaped leaving the scene with a rifle in hand. And O\\&amp;#039;Neill\\&amp;#039;s distaste for Kinsey, who had tried more than once to take down Stargate Command in order to control it, is well-known. \n\nO\\&amp;#039;Neill\\&amp;#039;s alibi, that he was alone on vacation fishing, is compromised when the murder weapon is found dumped in the lake near O\\&amp;#039;Neill\\&amp;#039;s vacation cabin. Confronted with such damning evidence, Gen. Hammond has no choice but to place O\\&amp;#039;Neill under arrest and then remand him to the civilian authorities in Washington. \n\nBecause the president, for political reasons, is unable to intervene on O\\&amp;#039;Neill\\&amp;#039;s behalf, Gen. Hammond suspends SG-1\\&amp;#039;s offworld duties and assigns Maj. Samantha Carter, Teal\\&amp;#039;c and Jonas Quinn to investigate the mystery and clear O\\&amp;#039;Neill. \n\nMaj. Carter surmises there was only one way someone could have impersonated the colonel so precisely: Three years ago, aliens tried to take over Stargate Command using mimic devices that could camouflage them to look like SGC personnel. After the situation was defused, SGC recovered 12 of the mimic devices, each programmed to impersonate a specific person. One of them had been made to mimic Col. O\\&amp;#039;Neill. \n\nSG-1 discovers that the mimic devices, under guard at Area 51, have been replaced with fakes. Carter has Teal\\&amp;#039;c and Jonas go through the personnel files of everyone who had access to the devices, while she goes to Washington to see Malcolm Barrett, a friend in the government\\&amp;#039;s covert National Intelligence Division (NID). \n\nBarrett tells Carter about an even more shadowy organization operating deep within the NID, and he reveals that he had blackmailed Sen. Kinsey into working with him to expose this splinter group. Unfortunately, that group got to the senator first. Barrett then takes Carter to an illegal arms dealer who had sold the murder weapon to Col. O\\&amp;#039;Neill\\&amp;#039;s double. There they find another gun that the shooter had handled, and Barrett has it checked it for fingerprints. They are not O\\&amp;#039;Neill\\&amp;#039;s. They belong to an NID agent named Mark Devlin. \n\nCarter and Barrett pay Devlin a visit, but his house blows up ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ a trap. They barely escape. Meanwhile, Teal\\&amp;#039;c and Jonas have narrowed the number of suspects with access to the mimic devices down to one Dr. Langham, who was supposed to have died in a car crash. \n\nJonas and Teal\\&amp;#039;c track down Dr. Langham and take him into custody at Stargate Command, where he confesses to stealing the mimic devices and delivering them to the NID splinter group, The Committee. The group\\&amp;#039;s objective is to take the alien technology that SGC has collected and use it for monetary gain, and they will kill anyone in their way ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ even a U.S. senator. Dr. Langham gives Hammond the group-members\\&amp;#039; names in return for relocation to another world via the stargate. \n\nMaj. Carter decides to trust Agent Barrett with the intel on the mimic devices. He, in turn, trusts her with the fact that the senator is not dead but in a coma, under 24-hour guard, and that a Maj. Davis from the Pentagon is on his way there. But Davis is actually Agent Devlin, camouflaged as Davis so that he can kill the senator \\&quot;again.\\&quot; \n\nAfter completing his mission, Devlin reports back to The Committee, who instruct him to next threaten Gen. Hammond\\&amp;#039;s family and, if Hammond remains unintimidated, to kill him. \n\nJust then, Agent Devlin morphs into Maj. Carter ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ who had used one of SGC\\&amp;#039;s mimic prototypes to create a subterfuge and get the proof she needs to clear O\\&amp;#039;Neill. Carter and Barrett had apprehended Devlin earlier, and Carter had taken his place. Agent Barrett comes bursting in with his agents and takes The Committee into custody. \n\nKinsey makes a full recovery and exonerates O\\&amp;#039;Neill in public, which, to O\\&amp;#039;Neill\\&amp;#039;s displeasure, will ironically help get Kinsey elected president. \n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEpisode 15 - Paradise Lost\n\nOriginal air date: January 31, 2003 \nCol. Jack O\\&amp;#039;Neill is at home, grilling hot dogs in his backyard, when his former friend Col. Harry Maybourne ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ the traitorous National Intelligence Division (NID) agent now wanted for high treason ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ shows up. O\\&amp;#039;Neill threatens to turn him in. \n\n\\&quot;Have me arrested,\\&quot; Harry says. \\&quot;That\\&amp;#039;s why I\\&amp;#039;m here.\\&quot; \n\nHarry explains that with the current presidential administration coming to a close, the president might consider giving him a pardon, as presidents sometimes do when they don\\&amp;#039;t face re-election. Harry\\&amp;#039;s bargaining chip: the stargate address to the planet with the cache of ancient alien weaponry, which the late Col. Frank Simmons had hijacked the X-303 to reach. Harry adds that while Simmons and the NID knew that the planet has a stargate, it was easier to grab the X-303 than to infiltrate Stargate Command just to use the stargate. \n\nHarry says he will give the address to Stargate Command in exchange for arranging a pardon ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ and on the condition that he can go with SG-1 to the weapons planet. Harry also explains that without the stone key to an impenetrable doorway protecting the weapons-storage facility, the address is useless ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ and he has that key. \n\nGen. Hammond authorizes SG-1 to check out the address and Harry\\&amp;#039;s story. According to Maj. Carter, the doorway looks like a transporter. But it indeed won\\&amp;#039;t work without the key, so O\\&amp;#039;Neill has Harry turn in himself and the key. Just as O\\&amp;#039;Neill is about to leave without him, Harry lets the other shoe drop: The key is useless without a combination that only he has. \n\nHarry gets his trip through the stargate. But when he puts his key in the doorway, nothing happens. Harry suddenly grabs Carter\\&amp;#039;s zat, stuns her and activates the doorway transporter. But as he jumps through, O\\&amp;#039;Neill grabs him. \n\nO\\&amp;#039;Neill and Harry are now no longer on the dusty planet, but in a huge field of grass and flowers. O\\&amp;#039;Neill has his guns and ammo, but the zat Harry stole didn\\&amp;#039;t come through ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ probably as a safeguard against Goa\\&amp;#039;uld weapons. \n\nIn fact, there are no weapons of any kind here ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ this was all simply Harry\\&amp;#039;s retirement plan. His story this time is that, ages ago, people from an advanced alien society chucked it all and formed an isolated utopian community. They sent out representatives to meet and evaluate people from all over the galaxy and offer them a chance to join them. The stone key and a scroll showing how to use it were the invitation. \n\nWhen O\\&amp;#039;Neill and Harry reach Harry\\&amp;#039;s \\&quot;utopia,\\&quot; however, it\\&amp;#039;s barren, a wasteland littered with skeletons. \n\nAfter O\\&amp;#039;Neill\\&amp;#039;s rations run out, the men eventually have nothing to eat but some fairly tasty plants that make Harry paranoid, causing him to steal O\\&amp;#039;Neill\\&amp;#039;s P-90 and grenades and run off. O\\&amp;#039;Neill retains his 9mm. \n\nBack on Earth, Hammond asks the Tok\\&amp;#039;ra to use one of their planet-scanning ships to search for O\\&amp;#039;Neill on the planet by locking on to his tracking device. But after almost a month, they report no signs of life there. \n\nExploring, O\\&amp;#039;Neill, finds a Goa\\&amp;#039;uld skeleton near the bodies of the aliens. An ancient diary with pictures of a man handing a plant to the people informs O\\&amp;#039;Neill that a Goa\\&amp;#039;uld had come through the doorway ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ and, knowing Goa\\&amp;#039;uld weapons couldn\\&amp;#039;t transport in, gave the inhabitants this plant, which eventually made them all go mad and kill each other. \n\nO\\&amp;#039;Neill walks into the woods, trips on a wired grenade and is knocked off his feet. Then a wild alien pig comes running at him. O\\&amp;#039;Neill shoots but ends up hitting Harry, who is hiding in a cave. Harry, now wounded and completely paranoid, runs off and starts hunting O\\&amp;#039;Neill, who gets the drop on Harry and shoots him. \n\nBack at Stargate Command, Carter, by studying pictures of the stone key, figures out that O\\&amp;#039;Neill and Harry are no longer on the planet ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ but on the moon above it! \n\nAs it turns out, O\\&amp;#039;Neill, for old times sake and in recognition of Harry\\&amp;#039;s helping Stargate Command on occasion, didn\\&amp;#039;t shoot Harry dead. While O\\&amp;#039;Neill tends to Harry\\&amp;#039;s wounds, a Tok\\&amp;#039;ra rescue vessel flies overhead. O\\&amp;#039;Neill arranges for the Tok\\&amp;#039;ra to find Harry a nice planet to retire on, so that he won\\&amp;#039;t have to spend the rest of his life in prison back on Earth. \n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEpisode 16 - Metamorphasis\n\nOriginal air date: February 7, 2003 \nCol.
