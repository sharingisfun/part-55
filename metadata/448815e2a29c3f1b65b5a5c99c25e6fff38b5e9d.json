Also included is the URLs to &quot;send message&quot; etc, and some other useful things.\nView the source of the page and copy it into a PlainText text file\nName the text file with the extension .csv \nNow you should be able to work with your myspace friends in Excel \n\nThere is nothing malicious about this simple application.  No viruses, spyware etc.  It only does what it&amp;#039;s supposed to do: scrape your friends so you can more easily work with your social network data.\n\nIf you are of the camp that feels that people scraping their own myspace contacts is unethical, I suggest that you consider that all the pages are already available and the data they contain is rendered in HTML which can be freely accessed already.  This is just a tool to make it easier to get the useful data separated from the clutter.\n\nFinally, this is possibly against MySpace&amp;#039;s Terms Of Service, so use at your own risk.
