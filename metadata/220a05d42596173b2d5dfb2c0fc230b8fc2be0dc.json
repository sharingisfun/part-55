The &quot;bohemian&quot; pig, playing &quot;Silo&quot; (think &quot;Halo&quot; for/with animals!) incessantly and using &quot;dude&quot; as his every third word was especially funny. I also enjoyed how the filmmakers openly admitted their lack of a big budget, by making one of the characters literally slap another over the idea of a musical number.\n\nThis film was fun to watch, and I hope to see more output from the talented crew that put it together. Bravo! This is definitely a keeper!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:220a05d42596173b2d5dfb2c0fc230b8fc2be0dc","amp;dn":"Unstable+Fables%3A+3+Pigs+and+a+Baby","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"220a05d42596173b2d5dfb2c0fc230b8fc2be0dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,10,5,212,37,150,23,59,45,93,251,44,15,194,48,184,252,43,224,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
