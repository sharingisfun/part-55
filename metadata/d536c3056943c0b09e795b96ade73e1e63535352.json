This long-awaited second edition of Dale Seborg, Thomas Edgar, and Duncan Mellichamp's &quot;Process Dynamic and Control&quot; reflects recent changes and advances in process control theory and technology. The authors have added new topics, and enhanced the presentation with a large number of new exercises and examples, many of which utilize MATLAB and Simulink. New and expanded topics includes: Mathematical modeling of chemical processes, Developing dynamic models from process data, Control system design, Process safety and process control, Enhanced single-loop control, Digital control, Multiloop and multivariable control, Real-time optimization, Model predictive control, Process monitoring, Batch process control, Plantwide control, Applications to semiconductor manufacturing and bioprocessing, and Control hardware and software","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d536c3056943c0b09e795b96ade73e1e63535352","amp;dn":"Process+Dynamics+and+Control+2nd+ed+-+Dale+E.+Seborg%2C+Thomas+F.+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d536c3056943c0b09e795b96ade73e1e63535352","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,54,195,5,105,67,192,176,158,121,91,150,173,231,62,30,99,83,83,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
