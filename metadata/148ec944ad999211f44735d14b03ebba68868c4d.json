For instance uTorrent shows that there's three(!) seeders on every torrent I upload when they've been published for a few minutes, and I have shared maybe 1% of the file. How's that possible? A month ago it showed &quot;only&quot; two..\n\nThe people who hate what I do block my listening port and slows down my bandwidth to an extreme low, and I'm being bombarded in comments on uploads and mails. The only thing I can do, is to appeal to you who are Christians, to help me seed these torrents, because I don't know how much longer I'm able to do this. Not for long, I fear. And I live in Norway, a so called &quot;free Nation&quot; of the western world..\nAnd then I'm accused of being a &quot;conspiracy-theorist&quot;.. :-)\n\nAnyway: A while ago I uploaded a movie by Jonathan Gray, which I named &quot;Lamb Of God And Ark Of The Covenant&quot;. Some of you might have seen it.\nTruly amazing stuff. And he has several more amazing DVD's to share with us. I've bought them, And his books too, and they blow my mind...\nI've NEVER read or heard anything remotely like this stuff. It'll change the way you look at a lot of things, yes even the way you look at the world in general.. This upload is to give you all the chance to PLAY AN ACTIVE ROLE in making this man's continued work possible. And your own benefit is actually priceless.\n\nThere's a link to these DVDs and to his web site, and his mail-address, at the bottom of this page.\n\nThere you can subscribe to his free newsletter, in which you get access to stuff not available to the general public\n\nAfter I uploaded the movie, I've realized that Mr. Gray is NOT a wealthy man. In fact he has sold all of his estate and now rents a place to live for himself and his wife.\nHe has spent, and spends, all of his money on expeditions and giving lectures. He does not even charge any money when he is invited to different places to give his seminars.\nHis ONLY income is from selling his books and DVDs, and he even personally signs the customs declaration on the packages people order. I've seen this with my own eyes. Know what I mean?\nIn other words;I don't think he makes too much money as it is, and I have written this by my own conviction, meaning that this is important work and should get as much real support as possible. And that is why I won't upload the DVDs.\n\nSincerely yours,\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;2056455249464952454d41494c60474d41494c0e434f4d&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;89a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;-----------------\n\nThis is Mr. Gray's offer as it was presented to me, and I hereby present it to you all:\n\n&quot;Hi. This is Jonathan Gray.\n\nDVDs, please? Can you get us some discovery DVDs?\nThat's what folk keep asking me. Yes, I've been listening. And also trying to figure out some way to place these within everyones reach AND avoid charging you for International packaging/shipping.\nAt last, after talking to some folk here, I've managed to get you a good deal on an 8-pack. I don't know how long the special price will last.  And no shipping charges.\nBut anyway, here they are, all of them in NTSC format - 8 amazing VHS presentations (on DVDs) (put together, very modestly - nothing fancy) - but the facts they give are astonishing.\n(Remark: You can also get them in the European DVD-format - PAL. That set has the 8 DVDs combined into 6 DVDs. Verifire.)\nSome of these are quite CONTROVERSIAL - but the focus is on EVIDENCE. So here they are:\n\n1. Secrets of the Lost Races\n2. Has Noah?s Ark Been Found? (In two parts. \n      Part 2 is Into the Forbidden Valley)\n3. The Lost Cities of Sodom and Gomorrah\n4. In Search of Pharaoh?s Lost Army (Part 2 is: \nSmuggled Out of the Desert)\n5. Ark of the Covenant\n6. Strange Signs in the Sky\n7. Secrets of Ancient South America\n8. In a Coffin in Egypt\n\nIf you'd like to see more detailed information about each DVD I have put up a special simple web page (which also has EASY ordering facilities). \nJust go to:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.beforeus.com/8videos.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.beforeus.com/8videos.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSincere best wishes,\nJonathan Gray\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;eb82858d84ab8a9988838a8e8487848c928a85989c8e9998c5888486&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;&quot;\n---------------------------------------------\nPlease tell your friends\n---------------------------------------------\nDid you enjoy this information?                 \nIf you know someone who would find these facts interesting, Click the URL below now to email it to them, or copy and paste the URL below into your browser: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.beforeus.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.beforeus.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou are welcome to put it on your own website exactly as it is, without change, including our email address:\n\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;b0d9ded6dff0d1c2d3d8d1d5dfdcdfd7c9d1dec3c7d5c2c39ed3dfdd&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nOr write to\nSurprising Discoveries\nPacific Coast Highway\nPO Box 785\nThames 3540\nNew Zealand","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:148ec944ad999211f44735d14b03ebba68868c4d","amp;dn":"Surprising+Discoveries+Presented+By+Jonathan+Gray","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"148ec944ad999211f44735d14b03ebba68868c4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,142,201,68,173,153,146,17,244,71,53,209,75,3,235,186,104,134,140,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
