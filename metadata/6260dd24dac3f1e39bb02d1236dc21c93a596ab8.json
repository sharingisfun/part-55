Usually I&amp;#039;ve known in advance his movies would be bad but &quot;Cleaner&quot; seemed that it might actually be really good for a change. It&amp;#039;s not really bad, but it isn&amp;#039;t anything great either.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson and Ed Harris did their job very well in the leading roles and Harlin&amp;#039;s direction was also good. Eva Mendes&amp;#039; performance wasn&amp;#039;t anything to hooray for though. The movie started off well and I thought to myself: &quot;This might be it. The movie that puts Renny back on the top.&quot;, but sadly no. The script is just too basic. You&amp;#039;ve seen different versions of this script on the screen many many times before. The characters and the world they live in might be totally different, but it&amp;#039;s still the same generic plot. One thing that bugged me a bit was the musical score which didn&amp;#039;t fit in some places at all.\n\nBut as far as Harlin&amp;#039;s movies go this is one of his better ones. It just needed that original surprise twist in the end that never came. I can&amp;#039;t really recommend you go see this in the cinema, but it&amp;#039;s worth a rent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6260dd24dac3f1e39bb02d1236dc21c93a596ab8","amp;dn":"Cleaner+2007+DVDSCR+XviD-COCAIN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6260dd24dac3f1e39bb02d1236dc21c93a596ab8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,96,221,36,218,195,241,227,155,176,45,18,54,220,33,201,58,89,106,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
