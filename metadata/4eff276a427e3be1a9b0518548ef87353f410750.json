I looked around, but there are only a couple copies floating around the torrent sites, but without the expansion packs and patches, at least not completely complete. This one has IT ALL!\n\nFor those of you using Vista and XP which are most everyone not lost in the stone age of the computer era, I recommend using various compatibility modes. I got it to work fine with a dual core AMD and 8800GTS running Vista.\n\nAll instruction are included in the README file.... so please READ IT and save yourself from asking embarrassing questions, however if you have other questions that aren\\&amp;#039;t listed in the README I\\&amp;#039;d be happy to help out. \n\nAs always, please seed at least 1:1 ratio. Others appreciate it as much as you should.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4eff276a427e3be1a9b0518548ef87353f410750","amp;dn":"ds9thefallen.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4eff276a427e3be1a9b0518548ef87353f410750","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,255,39,106,66,126,59,225,169,176,81,133,72,239,135,53,63,65,7,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
