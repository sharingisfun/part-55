Main application does not need 256 colors.\n\nEver wanted to play with electronics? Well, this is far more interesting than any &quot;electric genius&quot; box you will find!\n\nLoads of widgets to play around with. Connect stuff and see what kind of crazy machines you can create!\n\nRun out of inspiration? Try one of the many bundled puzzles and see if you can solve them all. Some of them are darned tricky.\n\nBundled experiment book not included, partly because it wasn&amp;#039;t that fun to begin with.\n\nWarning: May cause an uncontrollable desire to start programing for real.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:383446eef30c1c06d635cc45367d93f3223e9432","amp;dn":"Uppfinnarverkstan+%2F+Widget+workshop+Swedish+edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"383446eef30c1c06d635cc45367d93f3223e9432","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,52,70,238,243,12,28,6,214,53,204,69,54,125,147,243,34,62,148,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
