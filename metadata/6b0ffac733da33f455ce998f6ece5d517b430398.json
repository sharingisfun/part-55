The song is inspired by kidnappings in the Kashmir valley, specifically an article published in a magazine about relatives of kidnapped people waiting with hope for them to return, even as many months have passed without any trace of them.\n---\nParikrama has more than 1000 concerts to their name, which have been held all over India in more than forty cities and participated in various international competitions held in India and abroad.They are yet to release a full-length album, though they did release a free multimedia CD of their singles and videos in 2001. The band does not have any policies against their music being copied and distributed . They have made their music available for download on their official website.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b0ffac733da33f455ce998f6ece5d517b430398","amp;dn":"Parikrama+-+But+It+Rained","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b0ffac733da33f455ce998f6ece5d517b430398","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,15,250,199,51,218,51,244,85,206,153,143,110,206,93,81,123,67,3,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
