It was developed by the now defunct Legend Entertainment, \npublished by Atari and released on February 4, 2003 for Microsoft Windows. \nIt was later ported to Microsoft's Xbox on February 10, 2004\n\n\n\nThe main character in Unreal II is ex-marine John Dalton, \na Terran Colonial Authority Marshal whose job is to patrol remote areas of space far away from any real action. \nHe is called back into service to retrieve seven pieces of an ancient artifact,\n thought to make a powerful weapon when assembled.\n\n\nThe plot follows a set path like many First Person Shooters, \nwith the character going to various planets in search of the artifacts. \nLevel design at each location is also single-pathed, with a certain amount of puzzle solving and key finding.\n\n\nEnvironments on each planet are quite diverse, \nranging from tropical to desert, bunkers and industrial installations, alien cities and even inside the bodies of aliens. \nDuring several missions the player must hold a location against waves of incoming enemies, \nin some cases using NPCs as support.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c33457aa9e0f0fc931dfaf52fb709f3b618e759c","amp;dn":"Unreal+2+-+The+Awakening","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c33457aa9e0f0fc931dfaf52fb709f3b618e759c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,52,87,170,158,15,15,201,49,223,175,82,251,112,159,59,97,142,117,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
