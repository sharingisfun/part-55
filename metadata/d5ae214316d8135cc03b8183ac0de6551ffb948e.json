About 45-50 feet from the stage at a guess.\n\nA good fun gig: cock rock at it&amp;#039;s finest. One of the support bands was Theatre Of Hate and Billy Duffy joined them onstage for &quot;Do You Believe In The Westworld?&quot; It was the highlight of their performance . . . .\n\nIt would have been nice to hear The Witch or Ressurection Joe for once but this was made up for by the comment made by my mate as we left after the show:\n\n&quot;I really enjoyed that. It was great. Shame they didn&amp;#039;t do Love Removal Machine though . . .&quot;\n\nTracks:\n\n01 Spirit Walker\n02 Rain\n03 Lil Devil\n04 Diamonds\n05 Sun King\n06 Peace Dog\n07 Edie (Ciao Baby)\n08 Horse Nation\n09 Savages\n10 Sweet Soul Sister\n11 Rise\n12 Dirty Little Rockstar\n13 Wildflower\n14 She Sells Sanctuary\n15 Waiting For The Encore\n16 Phoenix\n17 Fire Woman\n18 Love Removal Machine\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5ae214316d8135cc03b8183ac0de6551ffb948e","amp;dn":"Cult+-+Birmingham%2C+The+Academy+2008-02-28+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5ae214316d8135cc03b8183ac0de6551ffb948e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,174,33,67,22,216,19,92,192,59,129,131,172,13,230,85,31,251,148,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
