It is based on an ARM 9 processor with\n512K ram, 4 MB flash, and a 802.15.4 radio part. The Sun SPOT includes\na &quot;demo sensorboard&quot; that hosts a 3-axis accelerometer, temperature\nsensor, light sensor, 8 tri-colored LEDs, 6 ADC lines and 9 digital IO\npins. The device includes a battery that recharges when the Sun SPOT\nis plugged into a USB port. For longer- term deployments, the system\nprovides a 36 micro-amp deep sleep mode. The Java VM, called Squawk,\nis specially designed for small devices, and can run many applications\nin the one VM.  This capability, and other features of the Sun SPOT\nwill be demoed as part of the presentation. Also shown will be\n&quot;SPOTWorld,&quot; a deployment and management application.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12801000064e0e7ae009ff17f951a2e93e2f1afd","amp;dn":"20080430-sun-spot","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12801000064e0e7ae009ff17f951a2e93e2f1afd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,128,16,0,6,78,14,122,224,9,255,23,249,81,162,233,62,47,26,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
