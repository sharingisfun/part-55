Singles A&amp;#039;s &amp; B&amp;#039;s focuses on the group&amp;#039;s original period of recording (1968-1976) and dutifully collects all the single-oriented highlights from this era, including such hard-rocking classics as &quot;Smoke on the Water,&quot; &quot;Black Night,&quot; and &quot;Hush.&quot; It also includes a number of non-album sides that make the package worthwhile for anyone seriously interested in the group. One of the most surprising aspects of this collection is that the B-sides are often just as good as the A-sides: &quot;I&amp;#039;m Alone&quot; is a hard-swinging rocker worthy of the band&amp;#039;s better-known hits and &quot;When a Blind Man Cries&quot; is a wrenching, blues-inflected ballad that is one of group&amp;#039;s best slow numbers. The format also allows re-evaluation of Deep Purple&amp;#039;s lesser-known material: A great example is &quot;One More Rainy Day,&quot; a catchy tune from the group&amp;#039;s oft-overlooked late-&amp;#039;60s period that weds a hook-laden pop melody to a combination of flowery organ riffs and Ian Paice&amp;#039;s hard-hitting drum fills. The package is rounded out by a comprehensive set of liner notes from Simon Robinson that supplies context and trivia in equal measure in a colorful layout full of rare single sleeve images. All in all, Singles A&amp;#039;s &amp; B&amp;#039;s works both as a comprehensive primer on Deep Purple&amp;#039;s heyday and also as a consistent double album&amp;#039;s worth of well-crafted hard rock.
