The band aspires to pass on their ideals they formed growing up, playing the music they love, and returning an affirmative message to the scene. Until The End is a favorite in South Florida, with an enormous fanbase. They are probably most known for their unruly shows with wild crowd participation and enthusiasm that is hard to forget. \n\nIts members are derived from some of the most celebrated hardcore bands to date. Chip works at Blockbuster and sqwaks for Dance Floor Justice. John was in Where Fear and Weapons Meet, Culture, and Morning Again. James also sings for Kiss The Barrel. In addition, John and Dan spend the majority of their time running Eulogy Recordings.
