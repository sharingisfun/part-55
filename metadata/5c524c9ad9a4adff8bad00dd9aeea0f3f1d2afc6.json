Each song is titled according to its track listing and none of the songs have an actual track name. For example, track one on Ghosts I is titled &quot;1.&quot; Reznor also states that more volumes of Ghosts are likely to appear in the future.\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ghosts.nin.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ghosts.nin.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nThis album is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial Share Alike license.\n\nMore information: www.creativecommons.org\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c524c9ad9a4adff8bad00dd9aeea0f3f1d2afc6","amp;dn":"Nine+Inch+Nails+Ghosts+I-IV+%5B320kbps+MP3%5D+%2B+Extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c524c9ad9a4adff8bad00dd9aeea0f3f1d2afc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,82,76,154,217,164,173,255,139,173,0,221,154,238,160,243,241,210,175,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
