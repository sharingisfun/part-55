Covers included.\n\nSnoop Dogg [born as Cordozar Calvin Broadus, Jr. On October 20, 1971] is an American rapper, singer, record producer, and actor. Snoop is best known as an MC in the West Coast hip hop scene, and for being one of producer Dr. Dre&amp;#039;s most notable protÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©gÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s. His catch phrase is &quot;-izzle,&quot; a style of slang invented by Frankie Smith and The Gap Band in the early eighties, and popularized in part by fellow rapper E-40.\nHis mother nicknamed him &quot;Snoopy&quot; as a child because of the way he dressed and because of his love of the cartoon Peanuts; he took the stage name Snoop Doggy Dogg when he began recording. He changed his name to Snoop Dogg in 1998, when he left his original record label Death Row Records and signed with No Limit Records.\n\n\nDirect Download:\n\nTracklist:\n01. A Word Witchya!
