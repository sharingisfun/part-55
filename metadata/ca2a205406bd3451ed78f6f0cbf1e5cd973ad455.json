At the time I upped this torrent he actually had a impressive list of upped software.\n\nHis executable contained a trojan (Vundo), so I replaced it with an executable which I downloaded directly from Raxco. I left the updates away (since the new executable already has these. This is my first torrent so do not complain if something does not work out properly (with downloading I mean, the files themselves are OK).\n\nHave Fun!\n\nEDIT2: For you folks out there that want a &quot;real&quot; free and decent defragger I suggest you check out this lightweight and portable program found on the following link: http://www.kessels.com/Jkdefrag/ or here: http://www.emro.nl/freeware/ for the one with a nice GUI (the first one is a bit more with command lines etc.)\nTo be real honest, I've been using it recently more then I've been using Raxco's one... But they both have their pro's and con's.\n\nAnyway, thnx 2 the seeders for keeping this alive....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca2a205406bd3451ed78f6f0cbf1e5cd973ad455","amp;dn":"Raxco+PerfectDisk+2008+Plus+KeyGen+%28Build+9.00+Build+52%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca2a205406bd3451ed78f6f0cbf1e5cd973ad455","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,42,32,84,6,189,52,81,237,120,246,240,203,241,229,205,151,58,212,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
