This acclaimed film looks at the amazing life of the renowned historian, activist and author. Following his early days as a shipyard labor organizer and bombardier in World War II, Zinn became an academic rebel and leader of civil disobedience in a time of institutionalized racism and war. His influential writings shine light on and bring voice to factory workers, immigrant laborers, African Americans, Native Americans and the working poor. Featuring rare archival materials and interviews with Zinn and colleagues such as Noam Chomsky, YOU CAN&amp;#039;T BE NEUTRAL captures the essence of this extraordinary man who has been a catalyst for progressive change for more than 60 years. Narrated by Matt Damon; Featuring Music by Pearl Jam, Woody Guthrie &amp; Billy Bragg.\n\nThe life and times of Howard Zinn: the historian, activist, and author of several classics including &quot;A Peoples History of the United States&quot;. Archival footage, and commentary by friend, colleagues and Zinn himself.\n\nThis documentary travels deep inside leftist political circles and, perhaps, deep inside any group of true believes who have held the same beliefs for their entire life. The major issues are settled, and there is distrust and an assumption of hostility in the actions of anyone or anything which counters those settled beliefs.\n\nIMDb: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416825/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416825/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYear.............: 2004\nCountry..........: AMERICA\nAudio............: DD 5.1, DTS\nSubtitles........: English\nVideo Format.....: 4:3,\nDVD Source.......: dvd5\nDVD Format.......: ntsc\nProgram..........: DVD Decrypter\nBit Rate.........: average\n\nMenus, Video, Audio and Extras are Untouched and Intact.
