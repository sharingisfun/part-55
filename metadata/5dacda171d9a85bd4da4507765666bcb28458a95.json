Pure talent. Pure energy. Six words that\n      perfectly sum up the sound of the Sweden-based punk trio\n      Neverstore. A trio that, if they had been told one year ago\n      that in 2007 they would be standing on the brink of\n      international success, probably would have laughed their\n      heads off. Taking their inspiration from bands like Bad\n      Religion, NOFX, Green Day and Weezer, they have found their\n      own sound, blending the hypersonic energy from the early\n      nineties punk with a melodic sense that makes you want to\n      sing along, combined with a tightness that is truly\n      impressing. The three guys in Neverstore know how to play\n      their instruments, and considering that they have spent more\n      than half a decade in the rehearsal place, that?s no\n      surprise. Spending their adolescence playing and making their\n      own music has also turned them into solid song writers. No\n      one-hit wonders here. Playing in a genre that?s not favored\n      by aspiring bands in Sweden, Neverstore obviously filled a\n      void, because the ever so music-thirsty teenagers have\n      quickly taken them to their hearts. The bands debut album,\n      Sevenhundred Sundays, hit the stores in January 2007\n      alongside with the first single ?So Much of Not Enough?,\n      which immediately got heavy rotation on the Swedish National\n      Radio as well as the biggest commercial radio stations. MTV\n      soon hooked up and gave the video for ?So Much of Not Enough?\n      massive support. The same goes for the following singles\n      ?Stay Forever? and ?L.Y.D?, that also became Fresh rotation.\n      As if this wasn?t enough, Neverstore has played over 80 gigs\n      so far this year, including the big Swedish festivals like;\n      Hultsfred, Peace &amp; Love, StorsjÃƒÂ¶yran and Pier Pressure. The\n      bands tour sold a total of 42.000 tickets! Neverstore have\n      also played support to international acts like Good\n      Charlotte, Billy Talent and My Chemical Romance. But\n      primarily, Neverstore is a band with a strong and steadily\n      growing fan base. Their first video has over 50.000 hits on\n      YouTube. In the last three months the hits on their Myspace\n      page have increased by 200%, now scoring 170.000. They are\n      described as ?The hottest band right now? by Sweden?s biggest\n      youth community Lunarstorm, and the major web community\n      Playahead started a Neverstore members club that within four\n      weeks went from 800 members to 8000! To top it all, they are\n      nominated in the categories ?Best Swedish Act? and ?New\n      Sounds of Europe? at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2007. Their\n      new video ?L.Y.D?, hit the airwaves on the 1st of October.\n      They are currently keeping themselves busy with the\n      pre-production of their next album which they will begin\n      recording in the next few months. In their latest video, the\n      guys can be seen wearing shades. Go figure, they must have\n      caught a glimpse of their own future?\n\n   _______________________________________________________________________\n\n      01-Rockthefool                                             02:00\n      02-Rejected All Along                                      03:09\n      03-History                                                 02:50\n      04-Hold On                                                 04:38\n      05-Out Of Breath                                           03:29\n      06-Run And Hide                                            03:27\n      07-Waiting                                                 03:59\n      08-My Greatest Enemy                                       03:11\n      09-And There She Goes                                      02:22\n      10-Count Me Out                                            03:09\n      11-Kings Of The World                                      03:50\n      12-Over And Out                                            03:01\n      13-Thank You                                               04:23\n                                                                -------\n                                                                 43:28 min","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dacda171d9a85bd4da4507765666bcb28458a95","amp;dn":"Neverstore-Heroes_Wanted-PROPER-2008-pyt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dacda171d9a85bd4da4507765666bcb28458a95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,172,218,23,29,154,133,189,77,164,80,119,101,102,107,203,40,69,138,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
