The group still betrayed a heavy Pink Floyd influence, particularly in its expansive art rock arrangements graced by saxophones, but Supertramp isn't nearly as spooky as Floyd -- they're snarky collegiate elitists, an art rock variation on Steely Dan or perhaps a less difficult 10cc, filled with cutting jokes and allusions, best heard on &quot;Bloody Well Right.&quot; \r\n\r\nThis streak would later flourish on Breakfast in America, but it's present enough to give them their own character. Also present is a slight sentimental streak and a heavy fondness for pop, heard on &quot;Dreamer,&quot; a soaring piece of art pop that became their first big hit. That and &quot;Bloody Well Right&quot; are the concise pop moments on the record; the rest of Crime of the Century is atmospheric like Dark Side of the Moon, but with a lighter feel and a Beatles bent. At times the album floats off into its own world, with an effect more tedious than hypnotic, but it's still a huge leap forward for the group and their most consistent album outside of that 1979 masterwork, Breakfast in America.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01.
