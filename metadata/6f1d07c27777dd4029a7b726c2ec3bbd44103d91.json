Honoring\nstyles that inspired him, he zigzags from rockabilly (the opening title track)\nto the Beatle-esque ballad &quot;Someday&quot; (cowritten with Richard Marx) into\nunfettered traditionalism on the shuffle &quot;Without You,&quot; the majestic &quot;Two\nHearts,&quot; and the Merle Haggard tribute &quot;Real Mean Bottle.&quot; His philosophical\n&quot;Young Man&amp;#039;s Town&quot; could easily be a commentary on today&amp;#039;s Nashville. While he\ncould have dropped a couple of the more-mundane numbers (especially the clichÃƒÂ©d\ncantina ditty &quot;We Had It All&quot;), he projects the same clean consistency that&amp;#039;s\nmarked all his work. True, he takes few risks, but then the cutting edge was\nnever his chosen place. And as the album&amp;#039;s sole producer, he shows better sense\nthan most current Nashville producers. Gill, the omnipresent guest harmony\nsinger on so many others&amp;#039; records, used surprisingly few guests himself, which\nkeeps the focus where it belongs.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f1d07c27777dd4029a7b726c2ec3bbd44103d91","amp;dn":"Vince+Gill+-+Next+Big+Thing+%282003-VBR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f1d07c27777dd4029a7b726c2ec3bbd44103d91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,29,7,194,119,119,221,64,41,167,183,38,194,236,59,189,68,16,61,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
