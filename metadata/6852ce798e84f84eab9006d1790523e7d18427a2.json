The process is very simple. First, create a map which becomes the stage of your adventure. Secondly, setup the hero, monsters, items, magic, etc,all the things you need to play the RPG. Finally you can complete your very own RPG by creating the events and placing them around the map. The New RPG MAKER is easier. In the previous RPG MAKER XP you had to use the script called RGSS but now you can use most of the functions with easier setups. You can save time by making frequent using events with one single command, and by making beautiful maps with little operation. \n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n1. Install the RTP\n2. Install RPG Maker VX 1.02\n3. Copy the cracked EXE from the &amp;#039;Crack&amp;#039; folder\n3. Enjoy!\n\n\nSide Note:\nI was unable to unpack RPGVX.exe so I had to use my own embedded exe loader, \nwhich loads and patches the original exe in memory. \nTherefore you will see two RPGVX processes, one (RPGVX) is the loader and the other \n(_RPGVX) is the original file.\n\nIf you have any information regarding which packer it uses, please tell me. It certainly looks like some kind of ASProtect or ASPack, but I&amp;#039;m not sure.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6852ce798e84f84eab9006d1790523e7d18427a2","amp;dn":"RPG+Maker+VX+1.02+%28w%2F+Cracked+EXE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6852ce798e84f84eab9006d1790523e7d18427a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,82,206,121,142,132,248,78,171,144,6,209,121,5,35,231,209,132,39,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
