Being happy is not only our right, he teaches, but is clearly the principle force that drives our lives. Our ability to attain a lasting happiness, however, is not so clear. The path of inner transformation begins with developing an understanding of our true nature. Once this door opens, one naturally develops a feeling of compassion and acceptance for oneself and others. In these difficult times, people are looking for answers to finding inner peace and happiness and arguably the greatest teacher shares important insights to getting there.\n\nDETAILS OF PROGRAMS ON DVD:\n\nMEDITATING WITH THE DALAI LAMA is a clear introduction to the nature and benefits of meditation. In a fun and easy going way, the Dalai Lama shows how to meditate and obtain mental happiness. This is the first step on the path to improving our capacity for joy, compassion and happiness.\n\nTHE POWER OF COMPASSION encourages us to forget our differences and focus on how we are fundamentally the same. So begins the path of compassion. Compassionate people are happier, calmer and healthier and create a pleasant environment for the family and community.\n\nCOMPASSION: THE BASIS OF HUMAN HAPPINESS goes into greater detail of how cultivating compassion for ourselves and others creates happiness. This allows us to be more sincere in our lives and allows others to do the same.\n\nContains nearly 4 hours of historic talks. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Path-Happiness-Holiness-Dalai-Lama/dp/B000HRMAQI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dvd&amp;qid=1207547676&amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Path-Happiness-Holiness-Dalai-Lama/dp/B000HRMAQI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dvd&amp;qid=1207547676&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d217f66fe7b33477d205af15ef2205dd9d9fdaa7","amp;dn":"dalai+lama-a+path+to+happiness.ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d217f66fe7b33477d205af15ef2205dd9d9fdaa7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,23,246,111,231,179,52,119,210,5,175,21,239,34,5,221,157,159,218,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
