Details here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0059043/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0059043/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe movie, in XVID format, has been re-rendered to remove the bottom ripple-bar and, considering the \n\noriginal, is quite good quality and perfectly watchable on PC or TV. This torrent is well worth downloading \n\nif you cannot obtain a commercial copy of &amp;#039;The Collector&amp;#039; on DVD or VHS. I had a terrible job obtaining \n\nmine. It had to be imported from The States, cost lots in taxes etc., and took ages to arrive.\n\nSo, once you get it, please seed.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4d05dcafe6154a408d502a9f247a61be393db86","amp;dn":"the.collector.william.wyler.1965.xvid.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4d05dcafe6154a408d502a9f247a61be393db86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,208,93,202,254,97,84,164,8,213,2,169,242,71,166,27,227,147,219,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
