Encoded with flac version 1.2.1 using the highest compression.\nIt was ripped from a mint record on the first play.\nGrabbed in 48 kHz 32bit (really it's 24bit (i hope) converted to 32bit), then normalized, then converted to 16bit.\nIf you want to burn these files on CD, you would need to resample them to 44.1 kHz.\nI used 48 kHz for 2 reasons - no downsampling and audio won't be resampled when played on computer - most of the modern audiocards don't support 44.1 kHz output, but i think almost all can play 48 kHz audio.\nCD version of this album is awfully mastered, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war\nHope you will enjoy this rip, it has no clipping, so sound should be better than on CD version.\nPhotos of cover and labels are included.\nReleased by parafin.\n\nTracklist:\n01-Deeper And Deeper (The Juan MacLean Club Mix).flac\n02-Kingdom (Booka Shade Club Remix).flac\n03-Love Will Leave (Kap10kurt Remix).flac\n04-Use You (Maps Remix).flac\n05-Deeper And Deeper (T.
