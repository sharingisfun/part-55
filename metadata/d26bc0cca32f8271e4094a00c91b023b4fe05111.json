The event was the culmination of the Indian Wars in which European settlers in North America had sought to wipe out the native population, but it was by no means the end of the European persecution of the indigenous peoples, as this two part documentary reveals.\n\n\nPart  Two:  Llooks at the continued clashes between European and Native American cultures in the hundred years after the massacre at Wounded Knee, and the disastrous attempts of the American government to assimilate the Indians. Indians describe what life was like on the reservations and of attempts to obliterate their language, culture and traditional ways.\n\n\n\n\n\n349 MB \n 00:49:09 \n XviD\n\n\nThanks and credit to the original capper and uploader.Please seed.\n Shunster ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d26bc0cca32f8271e4094a00c91b023b4fe05111","amp;dn":"Timewatch%3A+Savagery+And+The+American+Indian+%28Pt.+2-2%29+1991+++BBC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d26bc0cca32f8271e4094a00c91b023b4fe05111","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,107,192,204,163,47,130,113,228,9,74,0,201,27,2,59,79,224,81,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
