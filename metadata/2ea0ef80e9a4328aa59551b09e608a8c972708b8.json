And now McLanahan and his warriors have their first target. Driven from Afghanistan, the parasitic forces of the deposed Taliban regime have decided to feed on a new host -- an isolated, oil-rich Central Asian neighbor that&amp;#039;s ripe for the conquering. The battle for control of the world&amp;#039;s largest oil deposits has begun, with unsteady alliances forming and opposing forces set to collide. And now a handful of American commandos half a world away, aided by McLanahan&amp;#039;s unproven robotic warplanes, will have to triumph against overwhelming numbers in a war that nobody -- including &quot;friendly&quot; forces at home -- wants them to win.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ea0ef80e9a4328aa59551b09e608a8c972708b8","amp;dn":"air+battle+force+Dale+Brown","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ea0ef80e9a4328aa59551b09e608a8c972708b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,160,239,128,233,164,50,138,165,149,81,176,158,96,138,140,151,39,8,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
