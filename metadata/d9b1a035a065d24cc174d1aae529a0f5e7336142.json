They play solo stuff as well as a few unreleased cuts and songs Richie wrote for other artists. It&amp;#039;s the final piece of the Sessions set, and comprises all known Bon Jovi and solo demos which have not been released as b-sides or otherwise in an official manner.\n\nPretty much all the 2nd/3rd... takes are just teeny little instrumental bits. I don&amp;#039;t even know why they were included on the discs, but they were, so who am I to remove them? :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9b1a035a065d24cc174d1aae529a0f5e7336142","amp;dn":"Bon+Jovi+-+Sessions+From+The+Vault+%28Disc+10+%26+11%29+-+320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9b1a035a065d24cc174d1aae529a0f5e7336142","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,177,160,53,160,101,210,76,193,116,209,170,229,41,160,245,231,51,97,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
