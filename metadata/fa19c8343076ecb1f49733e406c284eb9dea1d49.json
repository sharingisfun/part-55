Highly recommended to any fan of Tom Petty!\n\nThe case is one of those paper tri-folding cases, so hopefully no one has trouble figuring out how it goes together. I&amp;#039;m not really sure how you&amp;#039;d print that off for a jewel case though. And the album includes no booklet.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP. (The Quality Music Project)\n\nIn this project me and my fellow pirates share only quality items out of our CD collections in lossless FLAC and include covers, especially for those who like to burn and print and put it in a nice and shiny jewelcase. Well, you all know the drill :)\n\nRipped with EAC\n\nTo check out all TQMP uploads: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/breezin/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/breezin/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/slavetothesound/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/slavetothesound/&lt;/a&gt;\nOr use the TQMP searchtag.\n\nPlease feel free to join TQMP!\nThe &quot;rules&quot; are simple: Rip your CD (no 1980&amp;#039;s cassettetapes or vinylrips please!) in lossless format AND include artwork. Include the TQMP searchtag in your title, so it can easily be found. (Yes, on Google as well..)\n\nIf you like lossless music, here is a group you can join to promote sound quality. And if you don&amp;#039;t appreciate the sound quality of lossless music, go get yourself a new pair of speakers :)\n\nBring back Hi-Fi!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa19c8343076ecb1f49733e406c284eb9dea1d49","amp;dn":"Mudcrutch+-+2008+-+TQMP+slavetothesound+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa19c8343076ecb1f49733e406c284eb9dea1d49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,25,200,52,48,118,236,177,244,151,51,228,6,194,132,235,157,234,29,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
