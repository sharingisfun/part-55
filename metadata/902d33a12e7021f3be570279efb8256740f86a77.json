As women's earnings, freedom and influence increase, the old sequential patterns of education, marriage, motherhood, and retirement no longer apply. A woman may set up a foundation in her twentiesâ€•when she sells her first company, support her family as the primary breadwinner in her thirties, start a new career in her sixties and remarry in her seventies. Today women cycle repeatedly but not in any traditional order through these stages: wealth building, romance and marriage, motherhood, power, crisis and loss, retirement, legacy building. In The Seven Pearls of Financial Wisdom, experts Carol Pepper and Camilla Webster offer women one invaluable pearl of wisdom for each of these key areas, helping them move beyond outdated financial-planning ideas to enjoy their power, transforming both their money and their lives.\r\n\r\n**PLEASE SEED**","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:902d33a12e7021f3be570279efb8256740f86a77","amp;dn":"The+Seven+Pearls+of+Financial+Wisdom%3A+A+Woman%27s+Guide+to+Enjoyin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"902d33a12e7021f3be570279efb8256740f86a77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,45,51,161,46,112,33,243,190,87,2,121,239,184,37,103,64,248,106,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
