In Whitby, an engineer is called to assess an engine problem. Tim is keen to see the town where Bram Stoker based the opening of his novel, Dracula. He finds the hotel where Stoker stayed and looks for the part of the coastline featured in the novel. Next is Scarborough where Tim filmed The Damned United. It's high summer and Britain's first seaside resort is crammed with holidaymakers. Arriving at Spurn Head they are now completely alone - there's no harbour or marina here. They moor to a buoy owned by the local lifeboat crew and wait for the perfect sea conditions to take them towards the south of England. They have to watch out for heavy sea traffic, the turbulence of the Wash and dangerous sandbanks. Arriving on the north Norfolk coast at night, a pilot boat guides them into the port of Wells-next-the-Sea. They soon discover it's a trip worth making as they explore this stunning coastline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/ba/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7a/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ac/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/32/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f0/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a1/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0b/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fd/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/15/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/81/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3c/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ea/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  HD Version \r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~3178Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.50 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 29 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 4\r\n * Part Size: ~700 MB (average)\r\n * Source: HDTV (upscaled)\r\n * Encoded by: JungleBoy\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01cmbc8","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2845d56f7e19ecde1dc1ef6d4b51d56f8d56db84","amp;dn":"BBC+Timothy+Spall+All+at+Sea+3of4+Gods+Own+Coast+720p+x264+AAC+H","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2845d56f7e19ecde1dc1ef6d4b51d56f8d56db84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,69,213,111,126,25,236,222,29,193,239,109,75,81,213,111,141,86,219,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
