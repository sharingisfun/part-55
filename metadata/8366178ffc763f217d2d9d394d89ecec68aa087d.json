This three part documentary charts the 50 year period that began at the end of the American Civil War in 1865, when all the western territories in America were opened up to be exploited.\r\nThroughout the series, Tony, a huge fan of western movies, investigates the clashes between the Native American tribes and pioneers, namely the famous 'Last Stand' of General Custer at Little Big Horn. He examines the infamous western bandits, including Butch Cassidy and Jesse James, often glorified in Hollywood's latter-day spaghetti westerns, to find out if the films he grew up with relate to the reality of the Old West.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  Part 1 \r\nIn the first episode, The Last Stand, Tony looks at the clashes between the native Indian tribes and Americans, namely the famous 'Last Stand' of General Custer at Little Big Horn. Whilst this was the one and only battle the Sioux ever won against the Americans, it led to the total destruction of their people and culture, from which they never recovered.\r\n\r\n2)  Part 2 \r\nIn the second episode of this Discovery series, Tony Robinson is uncovering the real stories behind some of the most notorious figures in the Wild West. Tonight, the former Time Team presenter looks at outlaws and lawmen, examining the infamous western bandits often glorified in Hollywood's latter-day spaghetti westerns, including Butch Cassidy and Jesse James.\r\n\r\n3)  Part 3 \r\nFinally Tony looks at how the west was won, focusing on the pioneers that capitalized on the opportunities of the West, one of which was the renowned Buffalo Bill, the world's first global superstar.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e4/Wild-West-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/61/Wild-West-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/35/Wild-West-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b8/Wild-West-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/32/Wild-West-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e4/Wild-West-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/32/Wild-West-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8a/Wild-West-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5e/Wild-West-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/86/Wild-West-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/eb/Wild-West-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/bf/Wild-West-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7f/Wild-West-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/30/Wild-West-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c3/Wild-West-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6d/Wild-West-Series-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3167 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 45mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 3\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 994 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.discoveryuk.com/shows/tony-robinsons-wild-west/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8366178ffc763f217d2d9d394d89ecec68aa087d","amp;dn":"Tony+Robinsons+Wild+West+Series+1+1of3+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGrou","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8366178ffc763f217d2d9d394d89ecec68aa087d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,102,23,143,252,118,63,33,125,45,157,57,77,137,236,236,104,170,8,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
