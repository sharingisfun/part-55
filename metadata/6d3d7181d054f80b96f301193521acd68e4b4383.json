This documentary features some of Dr. Mallett&amp;#039;s current time travel research. It has since been shown numerous times on The Science Channel.\n\nFilesize: 345MB (362481664 bytes)\nDuration: 00:46:27\nResolution and codec: 512 x 320 / XviD\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 48000Hz stereo 109Kbps\n\nRonald L. Mallett, PhD is a professor of theoretical physics at the University of Connecticut. He discovered a possible way to travel in time by applying Einstein&amp;#039;s theory of relativity to laser light moving in a circle. The program uses CGI to illustrate his theories. Mallett was one of the first African-Americans to obtain a PhD in theoretical physics. He was inspired to do so because he wished to travel back in time to visit his dead father, who died when Mallett was ten.\n\nHG Wells did it by means of an armchair and a cut lead crystal handle. The Starship Enterprise does it by unfeasibly powerful engines. And Doctor Who managed it in a 1960s police box, of all things. But just what is the truth behind time travel ÃƒÂ¢?? does modern day physics allow such a venture?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d3d7181d054f80b96f301193521acd68e4b4383","amp;dn":"Discovery+Science-The+Worlds+First+Time+Machine.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d3d7181d054f80b96f301193521acd68e4b4383","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,61,113,129,208,84,248,11,150,243,1,25,53,33,172,214,142,75,67,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
