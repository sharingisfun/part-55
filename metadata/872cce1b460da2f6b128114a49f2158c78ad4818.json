Unfortunately I don&amp;#039;t know much else about this recording.  From what I&amp;#039;ve read I assume Condon recorded all the tracks on his own.  Don&amp;#039;t know when said recording took place though.  One can hear some of the style that later becomes evident in Beirut, yet these songs are vastly different. \n\nAll tracks untitled.\n\nAny further info or other pre-Beirut recordings would be highly appreciated.\n\nEnjoy!
