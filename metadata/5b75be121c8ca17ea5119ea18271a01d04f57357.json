I initially expected the album to be similar to their last album Rise, but after a the first listen it was very clearly a different beast all together.  MKIO has once again redefinied their sound, providing the listener with a very dynamic and intricate work of art. \n\nThe production of the album is the best sounding IÃƒÂ¢??ve heard from the band.  Rise had a raw sound to it that I really liked, but in comparison, Trapped Inside is an ultra clean, well definied disc that blows the bandÃƒÂ¢??s earlier work out of the water.  MKIO redefines their sound from track to track, which is refreshing in an industry of albums with a single sound, track to track from beginning to end.  The album is also well put together in terms of the track order, which keeps you interested throughout.  I should also note that everything about the presentation of the disc is great as well, with awesome packaging including original artwork.\n\nNotable songs from the disc include Standing at the Edge, Lies, and Picking at the Scab.  Standing at the Edge is my favorite track from the album by far.  It has a great hook to it, and the guitar has a great rhythm that really caught my attention.  The bridge of the song takes it in a completely different direction with a cool electronic beat and arrangement.  Lies and Picking at the Scab are just great tracks with awesome vocal performances from Natasha Cox.  This album just doesnÃƒÂ¢??t have a single weak song on it, so I highly recommend picking up a copy for yourself!\n\nWhen it all comes down to it, Mankind is Obsolete has really impressed me with Trapped Inside.  ItÃƒÂ¢??s great to see a band thatÃƒÂ¢??s constantly growing musically.  IÃƒÂ¢??m definitely looking forward to hearing more from the band in the future!\n\nMankind is Obsolete is a great act to catch live as well.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mkio.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mkio.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nMankind is Obsolete - Trapped Inside\n\nAwake\t3:12\t\nPicking At The Scab\t3:26\t\nParasite\t2:58\t\nSilent Killer\t3:28\t\nTrouble Dreams\t4:13\t\nPassing Through\t4:33\t\nTrapped Inside\t1:43\t\nCode Red\t0:45\t\nStanding at the Edge\t3:48\t\nLies\t4:26\t\nFading\t4:20\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b75be121c8ca17ea5119ea18271a01d04f57357","amp;dn":"Mankind+is+Obsolete+-+Trapped+Inside+%28%40256%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b75be121c8ca17ea5119ea18271a01d04f57357","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,117,190,18,28,140,161,126,165,17,158,161,130,113,160,29,4,245,115,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
