Recorded in hte legendary Tuff Gong Studio, Kingston, Jamaica by engineer Errol Brown. Good solid reggae-album but nothing extraordinary.\n\nRipped from my own CD, so maximum quality control.\n\nRipped and tested with EAC (Exact Audio Copy), the best ripping program available. All tracks had CRC match between testing and ripping (basically that it rips every track twice and checks if the files are identical). LOG-file included.\n\nEncoded by LAME 3.97 with VBR=2 bitrate (specifically lame -V2 --vbr-new), as recommended by Hydrogenaudio for High Quality Audio: http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=LAME\n\nTagged using Quod Libet/Exfalso (Linux), an advanced player/tagger.\n\nI believe this to be the best version, and certainly the version where you get most information about the process.\n\nThis is no big label release, so do please show your support for the artist and buy the album if you really like it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c979576704b3d83240e392b8a0e59ae1bdf2a4a","amp;dn":"Kalle+Baah+-+Soon+Come...+%28VBR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c979576704b3d83240e392b8a0e59ae1bdf2a4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,151,149,118,112,75,61,131,36,14,57,43,138,14,89,174,27,223,42,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
