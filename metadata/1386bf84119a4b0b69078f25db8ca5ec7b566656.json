A sea full of wonders awaits. Famed oceanic filmmaker Howard Hall (Into The Deep) guides this immersive adventure that lets you swim alongside some of the most exotic creatures of the planet. Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet provide the narration. And an unusual array of finned and scaled stars are ready to steal every scene. Among them: Green Sea Turtles who gather off Kona so that Surgeonfish can strip harmful algae from their shells...an ominous, predatory Humboldt Squid that changes color four times per second like a flashing strobe light...an underdog Mantis Shrimp, whose claws have the speed of a 22-caliber bullet, in battle against a hungry octopus (the shrimp wins!). So many creatures. So many amazing stories. Sea them all.\n\nwww mvgroup org avi\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1386bf84119a4b0b69078f25db8ca5ec7b566656","amp;dn":"IMAX+Deep+Sea+XviD+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1386bf84119a4b0b69078f25db8ca5ec7b566656","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,134,191,132,17,154,75,11,105,7,143,37,219,140,165,236,123,86,102,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
