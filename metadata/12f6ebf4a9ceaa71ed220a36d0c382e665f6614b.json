I&amp;#039;d always loved him . . . And then we started dating . . . When the two finally move in together to begin their pleasant future, they discover that an old high school friend--and a girl!--has moved in nearby. \n  \n      The popularity of the Boys Love feature films has started a trend for misty-eyed BL youth films, many of them starring Prince of Tennis Musical graduates. From the Saito Takumi vehicles Sukitomo and Itsuka no Kimi e - Zutto Soba Ni Itehoshi to Kindan no Koi and Ai no Kotodama, these wistful, softly lensed films touch on coming-to-age tropes and the ambiguities of male love and friendship. Based on Konno Keiko&amp;#039;s popular yaoi manga series, Ai no Kotodama, a.k.a. Words of Devotion, is a sensitive bishonen romance that avoids the cliches of the genre with a touching and realistic story. Directed by Kaneda Takashi, the film stars Tokuyama Hidenori from Kamen Rider Kabuto and Saito Yasuka from GoGo Sentai Boukenger and Prince of Tennis Musical. \n      One day Yuki (Matsuoka Rinako, Nodame Cantabile) bumps into her old classmates Otani (Tokuyama Hidenori) and Tachibana (Saito Yasuka), whom she was close to in high school. It turns out Otani and Tachibana are now roommates and attending the same university. Seeing how close the two are, Yuki jokes that it is trendy to be gay, and then realizes that she touched on the truth. Revisiting the past through flashback, Otani and Tachibana&amp;#039;s long relationship is gradually revealed, from their confused high school friendship to their confession of love after graduation.
