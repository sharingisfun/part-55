Miss Fulham is off with friend Milly to a beauty contest. Geoffrey and nurse Catherine Lawrence have decided to spend an illicit weekend in the Grand Hotel. Arthur, May and the children are set on a more straightforward holiday of sea, sand, and pub. Meanwhile, the manager and performers of the &quot;Follies&quot; on the pier pray for rain.\r\n\r\nIn the United States Bank Holiday would run afoul of Hollywood's Production Code of the time, under which even an engaged couple could not spend the night together, let alone a weekend. In the end 1450 feet of film, about five minutes, was cut from Bank Holiday, after which it was finally passed by the Production Code Administration. It was released in the United States under the title Three on a Weekend, presumably because Americans would not know what a &quot;bank holiday&quot; was. The United States was not the only place where Bank Holiday faced censorship. In the Republic of Ireland several cuts had to be made before the film could be released. The censored cut had a running time of 81 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 640x480, 25.000 fps, 1604 Kbps, 01h22m51s\r\nAudio: MP3, 44100 Hz, mono, 128 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio, optional subtitles English and Spanish\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/pm5ckeh5l/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/q1txa0yax/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/i7tbomqi1/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/cv4hai2ll/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/rd1oihtwp/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99e560ea35c49a24cc821171adde43a8b6bcb5d4","amp;dn":"Three+on+a+Weekend+%281938+-+UK%29+%5BES+subs%5D+aka+Bank+Holiday","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99e560ea35c49a24cc821171adde43a8b6bcb5d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,229,96,234,53,196,154,36,204,130,17,113,173,222,67,168,182,188,181,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
