It was the era of the         \n            Second World War which inspired mayhem and lawlessness       \n            in Avery as well as the likes of Bob Clampett and              \n            Chuck Jones. These artists were able to exhibit their           \n            take on the senseless violence and pandemonium of war          \n            through their animation.                                           \n                                                                              \n                                                                            \n  \n                                                                         \n             Finally after about 5-6 rerips and over a years wait       \n             we have decided to let these go :P                         \n             Since its many different episodes all into one sometimes   \n             the AR becomes incorrect and you will see black frames.    \n             But in order not to cut down too much we left them there   \n                                                                        \n             There's 12 volumes in all for all you T&amp;J fans out there   \n             and if you must know..then yes, we will release these      \n             12 in Swedish aswell, but after the 12 in English are      \n             out.                                                        \n                                                                           \n             Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5cd255a49224cb2108685a48b87949bcec38c55","amp;dn":"%5Bnuked%5D+Tom%26Jerry-The+Classic+Collection+Vol+01-12+DVDRip+XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5cd255a49224cb2108685a48b87949bcec38c55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,205,37,90,73,34,76,178,16,134,133,164,139,135,148,155,206,195,140,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
