The only common element tying the stories together is the presence of a boy (and not even the same boy) in each girl's past, a boy who used to be puppy love, or an old crush, or a best friend, or just a short acquaintance. And this boy would have an influence over some part of that girl's present life. The stories ranged widely from straightforward girl-gets-boy romance to supernatural drama, and the actual storytelling and animation quality also tended to fluctuate noticeably, but on the whole &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot; is an anime that is unlike anything else out there.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d9b613aefe8ecb6029a7123358c6a3952243ca7","amp;dn":"Sentimental+Journey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d9b613aefe8ecb6029a7123358c6a3952243ca7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,155,97,58,239,232,236,182,2,154,113,35,53,140,106,57,82,36,60,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
