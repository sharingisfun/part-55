Each URL will then be opened up in its own tab. It will browse the 4 URLS for 3 minutes, close Internet Explorer, and start again using a different proxy. The use of a proxy is not required, but your IP address does not remain hidden this way.\n\nYou can go about your normal computer activities while this program is running it will not interfere with you at all.\n\nThis program is useful for sites that pay you to view advertisements. But does break most TOS, so use at your own risk. This is not an autoclicker program and does not work with those type of sites. Works with sites like LinkBucks and UCash, possibly others.\n\n--==History==--\nv1.3\n  *added website link.\n  *rewrote the code to be more efficient.\n  *ini file no longer needs the &quot;proxy&quot;x prefix.\n  *now supports infinite proxies.\n  *you can see how many proxies you are using by selecting &quot;Number of Proxies&quot; in tray.\n  *will now only use proxy for 3 minutes so some proxies won't tag you as abusive.\n\nv1.2\n  *removed duplicate entry in .ini file.\n  *you can now see what proxy you are using in the tray by selecting &quot;Current Proxy&quot;.\n\nv1.1\n  *added all CAPS to yes or no input box.\n  *added menu to tray icon.\n  *on exit will now kill the iexplorer process.\n\nV1.0\n  *first public release.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2b63da6038251f7ddc12f69c30df4c9700ad20a","amp;dn":"AutoViewer+1.3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2b63da6038251f7ddc12f69c30df4c9700ad20a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,182,61,166,3,130,81,247,221,193,47,105,195,13,244,201,112,10,210,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
