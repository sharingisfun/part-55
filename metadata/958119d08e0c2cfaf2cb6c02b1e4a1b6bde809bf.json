The potters are using a technique which is over 15,000 years old, coiling ropes of clay, one on top of the other. But the slightest mistake and their lovingly crafted basins could explode in the heat of the kiln.\r\nThe basins will take seven days to make, so in the meantime judges Kate Malone and Keith Brymer Jones set more tests of the potters' skills. In the Spot Test the potters must add a surface design to nine plain tiles, a technique which flourished in Stoke-on-Trent's heyday. And in a fiendish Throw Down, the potters are challenged to throw the tallest cylinder they can while blindfolded","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:958119d08e0c2cfaf2cb6c02b1e4a1b6bde809bf","amp;dn":"The.Great.Pottery.Throw.Down-S01E02--BBC-720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"958119d08e0c2cfaf2cb6c02b1e4a1b6bde809bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,129,25,208,142,12,44,250,242,203,108,2,177,228,161,182,189,232,9,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
