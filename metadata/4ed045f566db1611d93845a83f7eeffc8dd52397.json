It is perfect. No pixilation or anything. Enjoy!!\n\nOh, and here\\&amp;#039;s a description:\n\nDirector Davis Guggenheim eloquently weaves the science of global warming with Mr. Gore\\&amp;#039;s personal history and lifelong commitment to reversing the effects of global climate change.  A longtime advocate for the environment, Gore presents a wide array of facts and information in a thoughtful and compelling way.  \\&quot;Al Gore strips his presentations of politics, laying out the facts for the audience to draw their own conclusions in a charming, funny and engaging style, and by the end has everyone on the edge of their seats, gripped by his haunting message,\\&quot; said Guggenheim.  An Inconvenient Truth is not a story of despair but rather a rallying cry to protect the one earth we all share.  \\&quot;It is now clear that we face a deepening global climate crisis that requires us to act boldly, quickly, and wisely,\\&quot; said Gore.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ed045f566db1611d93845a83f7eeffc8dd52397","amp;dn":"An+Inconvenient+Truth+-+Perfect+for+iPods","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ed045f566db1611d93845a83f7eeffc8dd52397","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,208,69,245,102,219,22,17,217,56,69,168,63,126,239,252,141,213,35,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
