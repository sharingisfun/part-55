These cars drive themselves. There are no drivers and no remote controls, they must navigate entirely on their own.\n\n\n\nThe first time the race was run, the most successful entrant only made it seven miles into the 130 mile course. Will this year&amp;#039;s robots do any better? And will any cross the finishing line and claim the two-million-dollar prize?\n\n\n\nIt&amp;#039;s a story of set-backs and crashes, as a variety of teams compete to solve one of the hardest problems in robotics.\n\nAccording to RadioTimes\nQUOTE\nIf there&amp;#039;s ever been a Horizon film that&amp;#039;s more fun to watch than this, I&amp;#039;ll eat my TV previewer&amp;#039;s hat. There are some serious scientific undertones, but really it&amp;#039;s like a more grown-up version of Robot Wars. The Grand Challenge, which this film follows, is a 130-mile race across the Nevada Desert that the competing vehicles have to complete themselves. That&amp;#039;s right. No drivers, no remote controls. Just some very sophisticated computers, lasers and other gizmos. At times the driverless cars unerringly manoeuvre their way round several obstacles before ploughing straight off the road into a nearby cactus. While there are hilarious scenes, the achievement of the teams whose vehicles make it to the finish line must be applauded. I, for one, was whooping with excitement.\nRT reviewer - Jane Rackham\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs:\n\nVideo Bitrate: 1927 KB/s\nVideo Codec: XviD\nResolution: 688 x 384\nAspect Ratio: 1.79:1\nFramerate: 25 FPS (73831 Frames)\nQuality Factor: 0.291 B/px\nAudio Bitrate: 192 KB/s (CBR)\nAudio Codec: MP3\nChannels: 2 Ch @ Sampling Rate: 48000 Hz\nTotal Size: 746.08 MB\nLength: 00:49:13\nRipped by ashinc\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/broadband/tx/robotrace/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/broadband/tx/robotrace/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1e94c5cc8a6ba37544a0e85c106c700cdf74aae","amp;dn":"BBC+Horizon+2006+The+Great+Robot+Race+DVB+XviD+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1e94c5cc8a6ba37544a0e85c106c700cdf74aae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,233,76,92,200,166,186,55,84,74,14,133,193,6,199,0,205,247,74,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
