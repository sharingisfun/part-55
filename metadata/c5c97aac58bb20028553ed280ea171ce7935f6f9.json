For instance uTorrent shows that there's three(!) seeders on every torrent I upload when they've been published for a few minutes, and I have shared maybe 1% of the file. How's that possible? A month ago it showed &quot;only&quot; two..\n\nThe people who hate what I do block my listening port and slows down my bandwidth to an extreme low, and I'm being bombarded in comments on uploads and mails. The only thing I can do, is to appeal to you who are Christians, to help me seed these torrents, because I don't know how much longer I'm able to do this. Not for long, I fear. And I live in Norway, a so called &quot;free Nation&quot; of the western world..\nAnd then I'm accused of being a &quot;conspiracy-theorist&quot;.. :-)\n\nAnyway: This is release two in the &quot;Essential Series&quot;. It contain some of Larrys work from the Sixties and Seventies.\nIt's a nice release for those of you who aren't too familiar with Larry Norman's music, and a nice one for those who are..\n\nQuoting the album cover: &quot;These songs have been called the building blocks of the contemporary Christian music scene. They have been recorded by DCTalk, Frank Black, Cliff Richard and many other artists. Taking inspiration from the remarkable Christian faith and devotion of the American slaves and the plaintive, righteous music which poured out from their souls, these songs were written in the vacuum of the racially-insensitive white culture of the Sixties and early Seventies. This Album is dedicated to Joe and Margaret Norman, (and to) the brothers and sisters everywhere and to Fehrion, wherever you are.&quot;\n\nYou can shop for Larry Norman records directly from Solid Rock Productions Online Store if you've got either American Express, VISA or a Mastercard.

In fact I think he'd like it. (But that's just my opinion. Hope I won't be proven wrong one day.. :-)\n\nIn Memory of Larry Norman (1947-2008)\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;4f392a3d2629263d2a222e26230f28222e2623612c2022&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5c97aac58bb20028553ed280ea171ce7935f6f9","amp;dn":"Larry+Norman+-+Agitator+%5B2002%5D%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5c97aac58bb20028553ed280ea171ce7935f6f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,201,122,172,88,187,32,2,133,83,237,40,14,161,113,206,121,53,246,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
