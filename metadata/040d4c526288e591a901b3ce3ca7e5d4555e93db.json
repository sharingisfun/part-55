The film is about the problems and solutions file-sharing offers to the record industry. It explores why these problems exist, similar problems with technology in the music industry in the past (such as recorded music and public radio), and where probable future solutions could lie for consumers and the industry (eg new ways of making money while making use of file-sharing technology). The film was an independent project but covers some new areas not yet discussed on film as well as where file-sharing and the internet could be used to benefit the industry, musicians and consumers.\n\nEmail:\n\nBinsymusic[at]googlemail[dot]com\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:040d4c526288e591a901b3ce3ca7e5d4555e93db","amp;dn":"SharingMusic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"040d4c526288e591a901b3ce3ca7e5d4555e93db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,13,76,82,98,136,229,145,169,1,179,206,60,167,229,212,85,94,147,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
