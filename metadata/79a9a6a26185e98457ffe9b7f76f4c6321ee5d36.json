Starting in Amble and the neighbouring town of Warkworth, Tim and Shane are in awe of this historic part of England as they visit the Church of St Lawrence and Warkworth Castle. In Amble, Tim meets a young sailor circumnavigating Britain in the opposite direction who, like Tim, was inspired to take to the sea after surviving leukemia. In Newcastle-upon-Tyne, a place he is truly fond of as he has been welcomed there ever since he played Barry in Auf Wiedershen, Pet, Tim meets actress Melanie Hill, who played Barry's first wife Hazel, and takes us on a tour of his favourite places in the city. After Newcastle it's on to Hartlepool, which Tim discovers translates to Stags by the Sea. Tim and Shane soon find themselves trapped there after dramatically aborting a journey to Whitby whilst at sea. The North Sea once again reminds us that it's not to be messed with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/ba/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7a/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ac/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/32/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f0/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a1/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0b/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fd/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/15/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/81/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3c/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ea/All-at-Sea-BBC-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  HD Version \r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~3178Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.50 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 29 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 4\r\n * Part Size: ~700 MB (average)\r\n * Source: HDTV (upscaled)\r\n * Encoded by: JungleBoy\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01cmbc8","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79a9a6a26185e98457ffe9b7f76f4c6321ee5d36","amp;dn":"BBC+Timothy+Spall+All+at+Sea+2of4+Stags+by+the+Sea+720p+x264+AAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79a9a6a26185e98457ffe9b7f76f4c6321ee5d36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,169,166,162,97,133,233,132,87,255,233,183,247,111,76,99,33,238,93,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
