They are known for their atmospheric sound with female soprano lead vocals.\n\nRain Fell Within was formed in October, 1996 by vocalist Dawn Desiree, guitarist Kevin Thomas, bassist Charles Gore, guitarist William Rucker and percussionist John Brown under the name In Medias Res. Their original sound was a mixture of heavy metal and new age with symphonic elements.\n\nIn late 2001, guitarist Jason Wood and backing vocalist Laurie Ann Haus joined Rain Fell Within. With the new members they went into the studio to record a new album. The members on Believe recorded songs they&amp;#039;d written with and after Owen, as well as recorded one song with Jason Wood and featured a solo piece by Laurie. In 2002, Dark Symphonies released the LP Refuge featuring nearly an hour of Rain Fell Within&amp;#039;s new songs.\n\n\n\n\nTRACK LISTING\n\nQUOTE\n1. A False Reality ::: 8.14\n2. Alone ::: 8.48\n3.
