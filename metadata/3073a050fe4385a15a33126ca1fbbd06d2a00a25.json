In the first round, one of the chefs stumbles upon a brilliant way to treat scalloped potatoes. What to do with a precooked meatloaf is the big challenge in the second round. And the two final chefs go all out in the dessert round, making very clever sweet treats from a crispy snack and a sweet and tart drink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 10-Nov-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3073a050fe4385a15a33126ca1fbbd06d2a00a25","amp;dn":"Chopped+S26E06+Military+Vets+PDTV.x264-JIVE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3073a050fe4385a15a33126ca1fbbd06d2a00a25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,115,160,80,254,67,133,161,90,51,18,108,161,251,189,6,210,160,10,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
