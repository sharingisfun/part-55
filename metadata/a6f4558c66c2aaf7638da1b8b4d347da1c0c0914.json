Charting an intriguing fusion of industrial techno with the free-form organic passages that would become the norm in ambient techno several years later, Tales of Ephidrena was the first hint of what was to become the trademark sound of FSOL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCD Pressings Information\n\n\n\n\n\nLabel: Future Sound Of London Recordings\nCatalog#: FSOLCD102\nFormat: CD, Album\nCountry: UK\nReleased: 05 Aug 2002\nGenre: Electronic, Rock\nStyle: Psychedelic Rock, Downtempo, Experimental\n\n\n\nCredits\n\n\nEngineer - Stone Freshwaters, Yage\nFeaturing [Performer] - Max Richter (tracks: 5 to 7, 11, 13)\nProducer - Future Sound Of London\nSitar - Baluji Shrivastav (tracks: 2, 6 to 12)\nWritten-By - Brian Dougans , Garry Cobain\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nThe same as FSOLCD101, only this version comes in a standard Jewel Case.\n\n?2002 Artful Records Ltd.

AA have been inspired to create an album to near perfection which took 5 years to create. Influenced by everything &quot;cosmic&quot;, from Prog Rock, Psychedelia to Folk with a spiritual type feel. AA even got Donovan to write them some folk poetry on their album! Everything about this album is different from their past works, from proper instruments, singing, and there are even gaps between songs! I love all the tracks on this album, but the one&amp;#039;s that stand out are &quot;Divinity&quot; with charming feel good lyrics to the far out &quot;The Galaxial Pharmaceutical&quot;. &quot;The Isness&quot; is an album which opens not only your mind but your heart aswell.
