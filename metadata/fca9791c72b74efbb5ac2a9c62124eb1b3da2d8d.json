The place: the skies over the Pacific Ocean?.and you are the only pilot who has what it takes to defeat the enemy forces. You will need your wits about you to gun down bomber and fighter planes. You will need accuracy and nerves of steel to fly into the flak from gunboats as you try and sink the enemy naval fleet. You will need sharp reactions and loads of luck as you dive bomb vehicle convoys of tanks, ground troops and take out the all important fuel tanks.\n\nThe risks are high but the glory even greater for those brave enough to take the P38 Lightning and F4U-4 Corsair into high speed dog fights before swooping in to bomb targets on land. The enemy planes are super quick and the pilots ruthless, so don&amp;#039;t hang about admiring the scenery - get in there!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fca9791c72b74efbb5ac2a9c62124eb1b3da2d8d","amp;dn":"002-WWII_Battle_Over_the_Pacific_EUR_PSP-CROSBY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fca9791c72b74efbb5ac2a9c62124eb1b3da2d8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,169,121,28,114,183,78,251,181,172,42,156,98,18,78,177,179,218,45,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
