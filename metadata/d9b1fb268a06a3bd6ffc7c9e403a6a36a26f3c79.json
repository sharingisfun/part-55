It\\\\\\&amp;#039;s 1995, and the Tories have just carried out their disastrous, pea-brained scheme to break up the railways. We follow the fortunes of a gang of track workers in as they find themselves confronted with all the fallout of privatisation--redundancies, cost-cutting, corner-cutting and the wholesale junking of any concern with safety or quality of work.\n\nSympathies lie firmly with the ordinary working blokes, not above of bit of banter and skiving, but essentially trying to do a decent job and stay loyal to their mates in the face of managerial double-talk and corporate devotion to the bottom line.\n \nLoach cast the film using local actors and comics, and there\\\\\\&amp;#039;s a strong sense of authenticity in the flat accents and dry Yorkshire humour. The film is often  hilarious, but ultimately this is a lament for the destruction, not only of what was once a great rail network, but of the pride and camaraderie of those who worked on it. The film\\\\\\&amp;#039;s ending is fittingly bleak. \n\nQuality: Excellent\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: None\n\nPlease Seed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9b1fb268a06a3bd6ffc7c9e403a6a36a26f3c79","amp;dn":"The+Navigators+%28avi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9b1fb268a06a3bd6ffc7c9e403a6a36a26f3c79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,177,251,38,138,6,163,189,111,252,124,158,64,58,106,54,162,111,60,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
