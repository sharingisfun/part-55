Profiling on the customers&amp;#039; traffic should be performed before enabling blocking.\n-  XForce is investigating possible false alarms in HTML_URL_Unicode_Stack_Overflow.\n\n\n- The InstallShield installation of BlackICE PC Protection hangs at the end of the install on Windows XP SP1 and SP2. You may see the following error:\n\nAn error occurred while launching the setup \n\nThe remote procedure call failed\n\nIn this case, you can use the Windows Task Manager to manually terminate the hung InstallShield process at the end of the install without any adverse affects. For more information, please see the following Knowledge Base article:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://iss.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/iss.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=3812&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://iss.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/iss.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=3812&lt;/a&gt;\n\n- When you update from 2.9 to 3.5 or 3.6, your preferences in the BlackICE\n  Attacks and Intruders windows are not saved (i.e. the field\n  and column width specifications).  Also, your settings for the \n  Preferences tab are not saved.\n\n  Workaround:  Please note your settings before updating your copy\n  of BlackICE.\n\n- If you enabled ACPI power management, BlackICE does not \n  let Windows 98/Me automatically go into hibernate mode, and on\n  some systems even Standby mode.  \n\n  Work-Around:  You can manually put your computer into Standby or \n  Hibernate modes. We are working on a solution.\n\n- On Windows Me, restore points do not automatically occur.\n\n  Work-Around:  Periodically, manually set restore points.\n\n- For WinNT 4:  Under certain situations, the floppy drive is \n  inaccessible when the agent is installed.\n\n  Work-around:  Add the following line to blackice.ini:\n\n  starting.i=101\n\n  After saving and closing blackice.ini, stop and start the\n  Blackice service in the service list.\n\n- For Windows 98, using Dial Up Networking or when establishing a \n  VPN connection:  Under certain conditions, establishing the dial\n  up or VPN connection fails.\n\n  Work-around:  Add the following line to blackice.ini:\n  \n  restart.whenDeviceChg = false\n\n- Under rare conditions, the agent may not detect your computer&amp;#039;s \n  network adapter(s).  This means that although your computer can \n  communicate on the network, BlackICE fails to see the\n  network traffic and therefore fails to protect your system.\n\n  Work-around:  Add the following line to blackice.ini:\n\n  adapter.override = true\n\n  Save and close blackice.ini, then stop and start the BlackICE\n  engine.\n\n- When using the Communications Control in the Advanced\n  Application Protection Settings to terminate or block network\n  access of a trusted application and that application uses a\n  secondary trusted application to access the Internet, the\n  secondary application will not be terminated or blocked.\n\n  The workaround is to use the Applications Control and change \n  the settings for the primary application from allow to terminate.  \n  The primary application will be terminated and cannot use the \n  secondary application to access the Internet.\n\n- Using the Fast User Switching on XP the Application protection \n  prompts only appear on the first user logged into the XP system \n  if the unknown or modified application is launched by the second \n  user.\n\n  The workaround is to switch back to the first user and answer \n  the Application Protection prompts.\n\n- Under rare conditions the baseline does not complete properly due \n  to a virtual memory error.\n\n  Work-around:  Free up disk space on your computer and reboot the \n                system so Windows can allocate the proper amount of \n                virtual memory\n\n- When uninstalling on Windows 98 and Me, you may see one or more \n  &quot;Unknown Application&quot; prompts referencing various InstallShield \n  files such as isrt.dll and ikernel.exe. This may occur when \n  uninstalling any application which uses InstallShield, not just\n  BlackICE. As part of InstallShield&amp;#039;s bootstrapping process, it \n  unpacks and runs various files in a temporary directory.  These \n  files are not part of the file system baseline, so the \n  Application Protection feature will trigger on them.\n\n  The workaround is to put Application Protection into &quot;Install \n  Mode&quot; using the button on the &quot;Unknown Application&quot; dialog.  Or, \n  just allow the triggered file to continue (do not terminate the \n  file or your uninstall will also be terminated).\n\n- The agent is not compatible with VMware. Running this agent in a \n  VMware environment could result in unpredictable system behavior.\n\n- On some notebook computers configured to go into standby when\n  there is lack of computer activity (e.g. disk, keyboard, and\n  mouse activity), the agent may prevent the system from going \n  into standby because of it&amp;#039;s own disk activity.\n\n- The agent may prevent certain PDA&amp;#039;s from synchronizing.  If \n  this happens, stop the BlackICE engine.\n\n- Versions of Cookie Crusher earlier than Version 2.5 are \n  incompatible with this agent. Removing Cookie Crusher fixes \n  the problem.\n\n- If you are having difficulties performing SCANDISK or DEFRAG,\n  stop the BlackICE engine.  When your computer is busy receiving\n  network traffic, so is BlackICE (busy, that is).  As\n  such, BlackICE is also busy logging information to\n  your disk.  SCANDISK or DEFRAG may not finish when your disk\n  drive is in use.\n\n- Under certain situations, you may see the RED slash across the\n  BlackICE system tray icon.  These situations include:\n\n   - You invoked BlackICE Engine/Stop BlackICE Engine.\n\n   - The BlackICE engine is in startup delay.  BlackICE\n     has determined that for some reason, the system was abruptly or\n     unexpectedly shutdown in a prior computer session.  \n  \n   - BlackICE has detected a network device insertion event and \n     is re-starting to accommodate the new device.  In this\n     case the red slash is temporary and will disappear after a few\n     seconds.  One example, if you access the Internet via a dialup\n     modem, then it is very likely that you will see the red slash\n     appear every time you connect to the Internet.  \n\n     If you don&amp;#039;t want this to occur, consider adding the following \n     line to the blackice.ini file:\n      \n     restart.whenDeviceChg = false\n     startup.crashdelay = disabled\n  \n   - Your system has become busy to the point where the agent user \n     interface is temporarily unable to communicate with the \n     BlackICE engine.\n\n     If this is the case, you will see the red slash for only a short \n     period with no lapse in system protection from the\n     BlackICE engine.\n\n   - The BlackICE engine has terminated unexpectedly.\n\n- Applications that operate in a 16-bit environment may not be \n  detected properly in Win98/WinMe.\n\n  IBM ISS recommends that you avoid running these applications due to \n  their inherent security weaknesses.\n\n\n1.

Other Updates\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nIBM ISS is planning to update the HTTP parser in the IPS Content Update scheduled for June 10, 2008.  The HTTP parser changes will greatly increase the accuracy of HTTP signatures, decreasing false positives and false negatives.  A detailed description of these changes will be in the readme for the June release.\n\n\n\n5.
