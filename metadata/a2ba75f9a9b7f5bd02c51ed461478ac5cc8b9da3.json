Piet then introduced a Swedish band called Persuader to Thomen. Thomen liked the band and also liked the fact that the vocalist sounded very much like Hansi K?rsch. Thomen immediately said that he wanted to have Jens Carlsson (singer of Persuader) in the band. Jens brought with him Persuader guitarist Emil Norberg. Their debut album, Dreamland Manor was released in August of 2005. Thomen Stauch was fired from the band on August 17, 2007, due to his frail health, leading to the cancellations of many shows. In September 2007, Mike Terrana joined the band as the new drummer. At the same time Yenz Leonhardt became a full member of the band. The release of the Dreamland Manor&amp;#039;s follow-up is expected in early 2008.\n\nThe musical style is similar to both Blind Guardian and Persuader but does also contain some elements of Iron Savior, due to Piet Sielck&amp;#039;s writing. But, the band has a power ballad &quot;Beyond Reality&quot; on their debut album Dreamland Manor.\n\n\nLine-up:\n\nCurrent members:\n\nJens Carlsson ? lead vocals \nEmil Norberg ? guitars \nPiet Sielck ? guitars, backing vocals \nYenz Leonhardt ? bass, backing vocals \nMike Terrana ? drums, percussion \n\nFormer members:\n\nThomas &quot;Thomen&quot; Stauch ? drums \n\nDiscography:\n\nStudio albums:\n\nDreamland Manor (2005) \nForthcoming 2nd album (2008) \n\nDVDs:\n\nLive in Atlanta (2007)\n\n\nAs always, many thanks to all the fellow metalheads on this forum who keep the metal coming!!!!
