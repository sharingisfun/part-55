A combination of explosive live performances and a heap of interest saw The Magic Hands record their April Demo. The three tracks providing a dynamic sonic adventure combining solid rhythms and deep driving hooks fuelled by a combustible energy.\n\nThat\\&amp;#039;s perhaps a little over the top, but I\\&amp;#039;ll let the music speak for itself.\n\nThis torrent is brought to you with permission from the band, download it, stick it on your ipod and make sure everyone you know hears it at least four times. If you like these guys show them your support by keeping this torrent alive and letting people know about them!\n\n - SoS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:101c48936bb2b67da23e502b0ff7ab7bf5fb6be9","amp;dn":"The+Magic+Hands+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"101c48936bb2b67da23e502b0ff7ab7bf5fb6be9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,28,72,147,107,178,182,125,162,62,80,43,15,247,171,123,245,251,107,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
