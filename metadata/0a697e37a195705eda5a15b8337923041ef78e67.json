However according to the specs, the iPods with video and the iPhone support up to 640Ãƒâ€”480 video.\n\nSo I went ahead and created a 640Ãƒâ€”360 version which should look beautiful when hooking up a video iPod or iPhone to a standard definition TV.\n\nI?m an avid supporter of the open source philosophy. Showing the uninitiated that this philosophy can produce amazing results is one of my goals, so I hope this helps.\n\nI used the 1080p H.264 version as the source and transcoded using Quicktime Pro and Perian. The video also progressively downloads in flash players such as the popular JW Media Player.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a697e37a195705eda5a15b8337923041ef78e67","amp;dn":"Big_Buck_Bunny.2008.640x360.x264-ozz314.mp4+%28iPod%2FiPhone%2FFlash%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a697e37a195705eda5a15b8337923041ef78e67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,105,126,55,161,149,112,94,218,90,21,184,51,121,35,4,30,247,142,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
