The quintet as it stands today took shape in the spring of 2007. Ever since, the band has built upon itÃƒÂ¢??s reputation of an aggressivly charming force of a rock band on stages across the country (and beyond as well). \n\nWith a mixture of influences from bands such as Joy Division, The Birthday Party and Crime &amp; The City Solution, theyÃƒÂ¢??re serving up a set of short, sharp and punchy alternative modern rock tracks with an addictive and catchy pop element thrown in. \n\nThe debut album ÃƒÂ¢??Bring on the heartacheÃƒÂ¢?? was released on CD through Fold4 Records in February 2007. The album generated a handful of festival gigs (such as Peace &amp; Love, StorsjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶yran, Siesta) the following summer, with which the band caused as much of applause as of confusion. As of spring 2008, the band is about to release their follow-up, Baby&amp;#039;s Gone Straight, via I-Ration Records.
