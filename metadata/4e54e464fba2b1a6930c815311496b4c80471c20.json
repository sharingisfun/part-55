At stake is a place in the semi-final and their designs this week are more ambitious than ever before. But building big is fraught with danger and even the slightest technical error could cause their sculptures to shatter in the heat of the kiln.\r\nFor their spot test, the potters must transform an ordinary chimney pot into a decorative strawberry pot by cutting holes in the original and adding pouches to the side. And for the throw down, the potters have just ten minutes on the wheel to throw the widest plate they can. Judge Keith makes plate-throwing look easy, but who can match him for size?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e54e464fba2b1a6930c815311496b4c80471c20","amp;dn":"The.Great.Pottery.Throw.Down-S01E04--BBC-720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e54e464fba2b1a6930c815311496b4c80471c20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,84,228,100,251,162,177,166,147,12,129,83,17,73,107,76,128,71,28,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
