It will be deleted in the future.\nGet the new public one from here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5996599/TTC_VIDEO_Understanding_the_Brain_%28compressed_1.6Gb%29_public&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5996599/TTC_VIDEO_Understanding_the_Brain_%28compressed_1.6Gb%29_public&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nExplanations:\nInitially, I made this torrent private, not knowing exactly I did so (utorrent issue).\nNow tpb doesn't allow private torrents anymore.\nSo I created a public torrent, copy of this:\n\nSorry for this situation.\nYou should:\n1. delete the old private torrent from you client (not the files:P).\n2. download the new public torrent\n3. open the torrent file with your torrent client.\n4. set the path to your old location (it will recognize every file)\n\nWhen you do correctly, the percentage of downloading the torrent will increase rapidly. This being a sign that your client recognized the old physical files.\n\nStep 4 could be a little tricky.\nIn my case, I use utorrent.\nI customized it, so that it downloads first in a temporary directory. Then it moves the files to desired location (in my case label name, ie ttc)\nSo in my case, before downloading the new public torrent, I first move physical old files in temp directory. \nThen utorrent sees every file. It finishes the verification. Then it moves the files back where they should be.\n\n----------\nEND UPDATE\n----------\n\n\n\nVery nice video tutorial about brain. \n\nWell explained.\n\n\n\nLots of graphics.\n\n\nMore info here: http://www.teach12.com/ttcx/coursedesclong2.aspx?cid=1580 \n\n36 episodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------\nCompression mini tutorial (hope I stimulate others to compress):\n\n1. get SUPER (it's freeware and can convert everything to everything)\nSUPER RULEZ:D. It's the best converter/compressor I've used\n\n2. modify settings like this (or cut a little portion of video, then play around):\n 2.1 codec H264\n 2.2 set video width X 288 (width/288 must be equal to originalWidth/originalHeight)\n 2.3 set video bitrate somewhere between 240-270. I set it 240:P I didn't go lower.\n 2.4 set audio: mp3, audio bitrate 56kbs, sample rate 22050Hz\n\n3. Hit the button:D\nYou should get videos somewhere around 60-90 mb.\n\nThat's all\n(of course, then you create a torrent, then upload to tpb:D)\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8701742cbe27de2500f97a68b035efcf17cc4a3e","amp;dn":"TTC+VIDEO+-+Understanding+the+Brain+%28compressed+1.7GB%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8701742cbe27de2500f97a68b035efcf17cc4a3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,1,116,44,190,39,222,37,0,249,122,104,176,53,239,207,23,204,74,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
