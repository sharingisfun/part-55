The victims were innocent Vietnamese civilians. 504 mainly women, old\nmen, children and babies. They were murdered, and in many cases, raped by US\nsoldiers. This episode of the Vietnam War became known as &amp;#039;The My Lai Massacre&amp;#039;\nand proved to be a turning point in the war. In the My Lai Tapes Robert Hodierne\ntells the story of what happened that day in interviews with the victims and the\nperpetraotors.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nComment =\nThe BBC are very easy going with their material; for a corporation, that is. \nYou can download many BBC Radio programmes as MP3 podcasts free from\nwww.bbc.co.uk, but mostly for only a week after broadcast.  They don&amp;#039;t even ask\nyou to pay a licence fee ;-)  I still reckon they would be annoyed by breach of\ncopyright, but what the hell, this is a low risk torrent.  The BBC is well\nknown for its ground-breaking, award winning and culturally important\nprogramming (and a lot of crap too). I don&amp;#039;t pretend to be prescriptively selective with this torrent release.  It is just one pick of the best I caught, and would like to share it with you.\n\nRegards\n\nsteve_s","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a696c19b86c0929bd7d16fd8dd9cf2892f24b844","amp;dn":"BBC+Radio+Documentary++--++The+My+Lai+Tapes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a696c19b86c0929bd7d16fd8dd9cf2892f24b844","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,150,193,155,134,192,146,155,215,209,111,216,221,156,242,137,47,36,184,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
