The retention of soldiers in the service beyond their expected term. Using a loophole in soldiers? military contracts to prohibit servicemen and women from retiring once their required term of service is complete. Also widely known as a ?Back Door Draft.? ?Stop-Loss,? director Kimberly Peirce?s first film since the Academy AwardÃ‚Â®-winning ?Boys Don?t Cry,? is a topical and emotionally penetrating drama examining a government policy that has affected the lives of more than 80,000 of America?s brave men and women in uniform. The enforcement of the Stop-Loss policy makes each of them walk the fine line between doing their duty and doing what?s right. Sgt. Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe) fought for America. He fought for freedom. He fought for his family. He gave everything and then he came home to begin his life anew. But now they want more. They want him back.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56534bec64ae1283e9421d2a4f5289d1dd9d7abb","amp;dn":"Stop+Loss%5BCam%5D%5BEnglish%5D.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56534bec64ae1283e9421d2a4f5289d1dd9d7abb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,83,75,236,100,174,18,131,233,66,29,42,79,82,137,209,221,157,122,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
