But he inadvertently \n&gt; causes his brain to become magnetized, leading \n&gt; to the unintentional destruction of all the movies\n&gt; in his friend&amp;#039;s store. In order to keep the store&amp;#039;s\n&gt; one loyal customer, an elderly lady with a tenuous \n&gt; grasp on reality, the pair re-create a long line of\n&gt; films including The Lion King, Rush Hour, Ghostbusters,\n&gt; When We Were Kings, Driving Miss Daisy, and Robocop,\n&gt; putting themselves and their townspeople into it. They \n&gt; become the biggest stars in their neighborhood.\n&gt; A small VHS only video store faces foreclosure in\n&gt; a poor community. While watching the store for the owner,\n&gt; a blundering employee&amp;#039;s friend accidentally erases all of\n&gt; the tapes. In order to keep their blunder from becoming apparent,\n&gt; the duo of Mos Def and Jack Black begin remaking the films \n&gt; themselves using homemade special effects and outdated filming techniques\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; BE AWARE OF BOGUS SITES AND LAMERS\n&gt;\n&gt; DOWNLOAD YOUR DUQA FILES FROM DUQA ACCOUNTS\n&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/DUQA-TEAM/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/DUQA-TEAM/&lt;/a&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ENJOY!\n&gt;\n&gt; CLIP\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0799934/trailers-screenplay-vi1152975129&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0799934/trailers-screenplay-vi1152975129&lt;/a&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Official sites\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50d1ddbbe4e4e8ba84bd6bfe79f9179642146d29","amp;dn":"Be+Kind+Rewind+%5B2008%5DDVDRIP.XVID.%5BEng%5D-DUQA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50d1ddbbe4e4e8ba84bd6bfe79f9179642146d29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,209,221,187,228,228,232,186,132,189,107,254,121,249,23,150,66,20,109,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
