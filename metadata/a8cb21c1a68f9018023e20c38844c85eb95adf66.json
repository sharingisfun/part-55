This mixes the best elements of the theatrical version with the ones from the unrated edition for what could have been the best Die Hard movie ever.\n\n\nOriginal film name: Live Free Or Die Hard\nNew film name : Die Hard 4\nFilm studio name : 20th Century Fox\nEdit crew name : Uncanny Antman\nDate Original Film Was Released : August, 2007.\nDate Edit Was Released : May, 2008.\nOriginal Runtime : 2 hours, 8 minutes.\nNew Runtime : 2 hours, 1 minute.\n\nYour intention for this fan edit: To mix together my preferred elements from each of the released versions.\nHardware and software information: Premiere, DVDLabPro\nTime needed for the edition: 1 week.\nAdditional download links: Color comparison clip ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nCuts removed/added/extended :\n\nNote: Unrated Version used as a base for the edit.\n\n    * Color corrected entire film. Took out as much of the green tint as possible, and moved skin tones closer to red than yellow. The result isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t perfect, but it was the best I could manage. My advice would be to download the color correction comparison AVI firstÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦if thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not to your liking, donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t download the DVD.\n    * New title card.\n    * Reversed shot of guy choking McClane, hanging out of car. The original shot made it look as though McClane was backing up, not driving forwards.\n    * Re-instated GabrielÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦Timex watch in a digital ageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ line from PG13 version.\n    * When McClane is about to leap from the speeding car, swapped out ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦bad fucking ideaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for the PG13 version of the line. The Unrated one is an obvious loop that does not match.\n    * Re-instated ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI was out of bulletsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ line from PG13. The alternate line seems very cumbersome and not particularly ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMcClane-esqueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n    * Re-instated PG13 version of guard being shot. The blood that spatters onto the car is an obvious add-in, not to mention it is not on the car in any other shots.\n    * Removed scene of McClane and Matt stealing the BMW.\n    * When driving to West Virginia, removed reference to the car theft.\n    * Removed McClaneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s line, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFuck being a heroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and re-instated longer shot of McClane not speaking. The line is looped, and badly slotted in where thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no real ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“spaceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ for an extra line.\n    * After Mai kills the plant guard, swapped out bloody consoles for clean ones. (Later shots feature clean monitors, so this edit was purely for continuity.)\n    * Removed badly looped ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMotherfucker!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ when McClane is being shot at in elevator shaft. He doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t mouth any words at all, let alone yell profanities.\n    * Removed badly looped ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFuck you, bitch!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ line. It doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t fit, and detracts from McClaneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s triumphant yelling a moment later.\n    * Removed entire scene of MattÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s badly looped, badly edited whining, (after the plant explodes) and slightly rearranged the sequence of power going out across the country. Now, McClane hasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t just been standing in the one spot for minutes on end for no reason.\n    * Removed flight to WAR10CKÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s house. Not only is it completely unnecessary, it helps to make it look like McClane and Matt donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t just steal the KaludisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ car when they leave the house. Now itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just the car that they arrived in. (IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m pretending that the BMW was destroyed when the power plant went boom.)\n    * Switched out McClaneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s insult of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHey, Jenny CraigÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHey, Dump TruckÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n    * When McClane is being ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œvery impressed with himselfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ on the net, re-instated reaction shot of Gabriel that was removed from the Unrated for reasons I canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t fathom.\n    * Used theatrical version of GabrielÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s IT-guy executions to remove crummy CG blood.\n    * Removed McClaneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s line ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGotta get a gun. Keep your eyes open.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n    * Removed McClane picking up the wrench that soon disappears. Even Len Wiseman himself jokes about this on the commentary. Why they left it in is anyoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guess.\n    * Removed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDid I get a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Thank youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, no I got a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Fuck youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ I did not use the PG13 version either, (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦Crucified.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) as both are as badly looped as each other.\n    * Replaced McClaneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFuck youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBullshitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n    * Replaced ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m on my way to bring you a big fuckinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ chequeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSit tight, I got a cheque for you.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (Felt more natural to me, the alternate seems too self-consciously ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“R ratedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢)\n    * When McClane enters the refrigerated area, mirror-imaged the shot of Rand below to be right way ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢round. They clearly did it to preserve visual continuity, but I actually feel it works better having him directly under McClane, otherwise, McClane should see him too. (Plus, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s writing on the pipes which draws the eye when they are flipped.)\n    * Removed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMight wanna think about what to put on your headstone, assholeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Badly looped, and a crap line. Now, McClane raises the radio to his mouth, but is shot at before he gets a chance to speak.\n    * When McClane commandeers the semi, removed him looking around the cab and seeing the CB radio. BecauseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n    * Removed McClane using WAR10CK to patch through to FBI. No need for it at all. The next line we hear, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis is Central. We have a patch for Director Bowman.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Tells us all we need to know. Taking the scene out also removes some terrible continuity with the damage to the truck.\n    * Removed F35 firing the first missile at truck, and freeway collapsing. It just seems too sudden, out of nowhere. The first attack is now as it swoops in front of the truck. This way, the attack escalatesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦bullets, then missiles.\n    * Replaced McClane being shot by Gabriel with the PG13 version. The blood in the Unrated is very poorly added.\n    * Several other extremely minor edits which donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t really bear listing.\n\n\n\n\nFanedit Community:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.avpsgallery.fanedit.org/index.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.avpsgallery.fanedit.org/index.php&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.fanedit.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.fanedit.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://WWW.forum.fanedit.org/index.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://WWW.forum.fanedit.org/index.php&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.originaltrilogy.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.originaltrilogy.com&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8cb21c1a68f9018023e20c38844c85eb95adf66","amp;dn":"Die+Hard+4+-+An+Uncanny+Antman+Fanedit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8cb21c1a68f9018023e20c38844c85eb95adf66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,203,33,193,166,143,144,24,2,62,32,195,136,68,200,94,185,90,223,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
