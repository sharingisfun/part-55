All of them, even the dude, dress in skimpy Day-Glo and garish metallic outfits, as if they were extras in Moulin Rouge (or Shaft). But Jypsi actually resemble the Dixie Chicks and Little Big Town in the way they inject the mainstream Nashville sound with breezy &amp;#039;70s country-rock. As with vintage Eagles, layered harmonies sparkle like Swarovski crystal while mandolins, guitars and fiddles are played with back-porch ease (save for a nasty bluegrass breakdown or two).\n\n\nInformation Disc:\n\n?
