Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions â€“ Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness. The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Rileyâ€™s mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Rileyâ€™s main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.\r\n\r\nSCREENSHOTS:-\r\n \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/Untitled-1_1.jpg\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ea89b98face15d892982536122db3b74f3d4d7d","amp;dn":"Inside+Out+%282015%29+%5BEng%5D+480p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ea89b98face15d892982536122db3b74f3d4d7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,168,155,152,250,206,21,216,146,152,37,54,18,45,179,183,79,61,77,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
