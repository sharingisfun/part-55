And while Russell T. Davies did produce a good number of outstanding episodes to mark the return of Doctor Who, many fans agree that it\\&amp;#039;s time for him to go, and we won\\&amp;#039;t miss the gay agenda that never really belonged in the program to begin with.   \n\nToday marks the announcement of Steven Moffett as the new producer, so if that interests you, and you don\\&amp;#039;t mind spoliers, here we go.   \n\nThe final episode of season 4, final episode with RTD (and hopefully the final episode with alternative sexual agendas delicately and bluntly interlaced will be this summer.    Season 04 Episode 12 will be the second of two parts titled \\&quot;Journeys End\\&quot;.   \n\nAnd the Doctor dies.   David Tennant will appear as the doctor for the last time in  this episode, you can see in these production photos where he is killed off.  \n\nNow he will be appearing again in one of the 2009 episodes, but this one is his last as the current Doctor.   \n\nBillie Piper returns as Rose, along with her Mum.  Nice shot of her with a giant gun as she tries to fend off;\n\nNothing but The Daleks and Davros himself.     \n\nWhat a wonderful way for Doctor 10 to be forced into regeneration by nothing but the Daleks and Davros himself.   \n\nSo long RTD (gladly), so long David Tennent (sadly), welcome back Rose, and WELCOME Moffett!   \n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7995318b5ed59bd8f4f1a9c7ae45c7f3682e614","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+S04E12+Journeys+End+-+Spoiler+Filming+Photos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7995318b5ed59bd8f4f1a9c7ae45c7f3682e614","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,153,83,24,181,237,89,189,143,79,26,156,122,228,92,127,54,130,230,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
