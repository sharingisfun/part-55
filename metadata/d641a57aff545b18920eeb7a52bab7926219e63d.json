However, prodded by his major conservative supporter, Joanne     \n Herring, Wilson learns about the plight of the people are suffering in the   \n brutal Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. With the help of the maverick CIA   \n agent, Gust Avrakotos, Wilson dedicates his canny political efforts to       \n supply the Afghan mujahideen with the weapons and support to defeat the      \n Soviet Union. However, Charlie Wilson eventually learns that while military  \n victory can had, there are other consequences and prices to that fight that  \n are ignored to everyone&amp;#039;s sorrow.                                            \n                                                                              \n\n\n                           Happy Hacker Industries                            \nThis movie should play fine on most DVD/DivX Certified settop\ndvd players.
