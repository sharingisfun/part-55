Through his drug addiction, \n\nAbberline is &quot;chasing the dragon&quot;; when the fragile \n\nvulnerability of his character is exposed, the viewer \n\nlearns the detective is chasing much, much more.\n  Ian Holm plays Sir William Gull, an aging physician of \n\nBritain's royal family. The good doctor is so calm, cold, \n\nreserved, detached, and calculating I'll wager he could \n\nfreeze the mercury on a thermometer. Holm and Depp \n\neasily carry this movie, augmented by haunting images \n\nof avarice, brutality, and a less than complimentary \n\nportrayal of the freemasons.\n\n  Starring: Johnny Depp, Heather Graham, Ian Holm, \n\nRobbie Coltrane, Ian Richardson.\n\n  Directed by: Albert Hughes.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 57min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x 336","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d26ca2c559801969e21c7f9e6d04798f8a6ae30b","amp;dn":"From+Hell+%282001%29+%28Johnny+Depp%2C+Heather+Graham%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d26ca2c559801969e21c7f9e6d04798f8a6ae30b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,108,162,197,89,128,25,105,226,28,127,158,109,4,121,143,138,106,227,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
