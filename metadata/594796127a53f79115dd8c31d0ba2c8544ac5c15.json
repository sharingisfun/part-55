She shares the room with her ghost boyfriend, Ake, who has been left legless by Rahtree after his transgressions in the first film. A blind woman named Thip rents a neighboring apartment. She is due for an eye operation, but the doctor treating her tries to rape her. He is stopped by Rahtree. Meanwhile, a comic foursome of bank robbers have entered Rahtree&amp;#039;s apartment and are using it as a hideout.\n\nA group of down-on-their-luck comedians turn to bank robbery to keep food on the table. They unwittingly use a haunted apartment for their hideout and when their money goes missing, they break into the sealed sixth floor and find the money in the mysterious room 609 where they become trapped by a ghost...\n\n\nThe film was screened in competition at the 2005 Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival with the best actor prize being shared among the four comedian actors: Phan Rojanarangsri, Supakorn Srisawat, Somjai Sukjai and Banphot Weerarat.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:594796127a53f79115dd8c31d0ba2c8544ac5c15","amp;dn":"%5BThai+Movie%5D+-+Rahtree+Returns+-+2005","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"594796127a53f79115dd8c31d0ba2c8544ac5c15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,71,150,18,122,83,247,145,21,221,140,49,208,186,44,133,68,172,92,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
