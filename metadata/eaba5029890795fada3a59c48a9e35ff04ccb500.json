Its a comedy roller coaster, 29 April 2008\n\nAuthor: prateekarora from United States \n\nOh my god, I still don&amp;#039;t know what hit me. I have been a big fan of the first part but this one is a different league guys. Not a single boring moment, very nice editing. And our favorite characters have done it again. They didn&amp;#039;t leave a single stereotype and ignorance untouched in the movie.\n\nTrust me it will not be fair to compare the White Castle part with this one, as this is just a different experience no less than a roller coaster ride of genuine comedy. This movie has taken what it did in the first one, to the next but different level. To point out, as pretty clear from the uncensored trailers, it was awesome to see NPH and G &quot;Dubya&quot; Bush. Cho and Penn are just non-stop fun and have some really hot girl friends. From Ta-Ta&amp;#039;s of girls to bottom less parties, nothing felt out of place. We also get to know allot about H&amp;K&amp;#039;s past.\n\nIt deserves a standing ovation and that&amp;#039;s what it got from the audience in the theater. Oh man, I am so getting this on DVD when the extended unrated version comes out.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eaba5029890795fada3a59c48a9e35ff04ccb500","amp;dn":"Harold+%26+Kumar+Escape+from+Guantanamo+Bay_SUBBED_CAM_XViD_PreVai","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eaba5029890795fada3a59c48a9e35ff04ccb500","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,186,80,41,137,7,149,250,218,58,89,196,138,158,53,255,4,204,181,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
