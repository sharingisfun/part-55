After that, he simply puts some other cool .exe file into the same folder as the rest of the files. Changes one file real quick to make sure it runs the cool .exe at the beginning. Then the user would use Winrar(or some program like it) to create a SFX(Self Extracting File) which he sets a few options, like where to install the files and to run AutoRun.bat right after the file is extracted. Once all that stuff is done, which is pretty easy after you do it once or twice, then it&amp;#039;s just a matter of getting the file onto the victim&amp;#039;s computer.\n\nAgain, none of this is to be used for malicious purposes. I know it can be, but thats like any other hacking tool out there that Ethical Hackers use to prove servers are not secure. What you do with this program and the knowledge learned from it is your choice, not mine. Therefore, I am not responsible in any way. \n\n\nRemember J0-Y always upload 100% virus free torrents!!!\n\n\nPlease seed after downloading!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd561fce86ac313bd8a08906812e04ba9cb76d6c","amp;dn":"InfectUS+%2B+Tutorial+-+J0-Y","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd561fce86ac313bd8a08906812e04ba9cb76d6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,86,31,206,134,172,49,59,216,160,137,6,129,46,4,186,156,183,109,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
