For instance uTorrent shows that there's three(!) seeders on every torrent I upload when they've been published for a few minutes, and I have shared maybe 1% of the file. How's that possible? A month ago it showed &quot;only&quot; two..\n\nThe people who hate what I do block my listening port and slows down my bandwidth to an extreme low, and I'm being bombarded in comments on uploads and mails. The only thing I can do, is to appeal to you who are Christians, to help me seed these torrents, because I don't know how much longer I'm able to do this. Not for long, I fear. And I live in Norway, a so called &quot;free Nation&quot; of the western world..\nAnd then I'm accused of being a &quot;conspiracy-theorist&quot;.. :-)\n\nAbout the upload: Larry Norman finally ended his work among us in late February 2008.\nHe suffered a major heart attack in 1992, but the doctors at the hospital didn't give him an EKG, so they diagnosed him with severe indigestion instead.\nThe heart attack destroyed more than half of his heart, and finally led to his death at the age of 60.\nBut he lives on; With his Lord and Saviour in heaven, and through his music and through the many lives that was touched and changed by his hard work.\n\nOne of the first albums I heard with Larry, was this one. I have been looking for it for a long time, but couldn't get it.\nThese days you can't get far without a creditcard..\n(Some countries (like Morocco)won't even let you stay for a longer period than three months without a VISA, no matter how many Euros or Dollars you might want to spend there.. Guess what's coming next..? (hint: Try track 11 on for size)  But I digress. Sorry..(?))\n\nAnyway. I finally got the album, and now even those without VISAs but with a computer can get it.. I think Larry would have liked that..\n\nSo; In memory of Larry Norman (1947-2008): In Another Land.\nIt's a great and beautiful album, and I've included the lyrics for the original 15 tracks.. Nice reading while listening.. :-)\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;a7d1c2d5cec1ced5c2cac6cecbe7c0cac6cecb89c4c8ca&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a4e78c178222598d2bd21f6471f2c9b10030697","amp;dn":"Larry+Norman+-+In+Another+Land+%5B1975%5D+-+30th+Anniversary+Ed.%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a4e78c178222598d2bd21f6471f2c9b10030697","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,78,120,193,120,34,37,152,210,189,33,246,71,31,44,155,16,3,6,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
