Her travels also put her in contact with the seedier\ninhabitants of the city. Like Lance, her would-be saviour who\nultimately puts her life in jeopardy.\n\nTraceys stories begin to intertwine truth with lies, and hope with\ndespair as we move closer to the truth of Sonnys disappearance.\n\nThe Tracey Fragments stars Ellen Page in the title role and will\nhave a limited theatrical release in the United States May 9th, 2008.\n\nEPiCs Notes\n\nThe.Tracey.Fragments.2007.DVDRip.XviD-AsiSter is full of blended\nfields. Check for example frames 14, 17, 25, 29, 37, 41, 49, 62 and\n67 in the sample we have cut from their release.\n\nAlso a note about the audio in their release. GSpot reports that the\naudio is Two Mono Channels. This does not mean that their release\nhas mono audio but it is not the optimal mode to use. What it means\nis that it has two channels that have been encoded independently.\nThe more common Joint Stereo is better because it allows the encoder\nto take advantage of the similarities between the left and right\nchannels. This means that it can give you the same quality at a lower\nbitrate.\n\nThis proper is from the region 2 PAL DVD. The DVD suffers from a lot\nof blended fields. Removing these left us with 23.976 fps.\n\nThe sample dir contains, in addition to the sample from our encode,\na sample cut from AsiSters encode and a vob sample.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:717150b3e1bcb449f343412c7de6ebf8ff463bae","amp;dn":"The.Tracey.Fragments.2007.PROPER.LiMiTED.DVDRip.XviD-EPiC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"717150b3e1bcb449f343412c7de6ebf8ff463bae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,113,80,179,225,188,180,73,243,67,65,44,125,230,235,248,255,70,59,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
