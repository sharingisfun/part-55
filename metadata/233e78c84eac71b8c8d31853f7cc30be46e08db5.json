It was later adapted into a comedy anime series on Kids Station, a Japanese broadcast satellite station. It features characters that wear kemonomimi costumes. Each character in the anime does not live up to the standards of their species, making them outcasts who must live in the &quot;Useless&quot; Forest. The main character Uruno is a wolf who has the personality of a shy rabbit, meanwhile Usahara, a rabbit, acts like a wolf. Each of the 26 episodes is 5 minutes long, bringing the total series to 130 minutes (2 hours 10 minutes).\n\nTofolks: don&amp;#039;t get mad -- I believe it&amp;#039;s better get this torrent more seeds, as I won&amp;#039;t last forever, than let it die in obscurity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:233e78c84eac71b8c8d31853f7cc30be46e08db5","amp;dn":"Damekko+Dobutsu+%28Dobutsu%29%2C+%5C%22Useless+Animals%5C%22","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"233e78c84eac71b8c8d31853f7cc30be46e08db5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,62,120,200,78,172,113,184,200,211,24,83,247,204,48,190,70,224,141,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
