DJ Mikael &amp; Yoshi mix up the tunes for Guarana and DJ James Scott for Base. Both very different vibes but brilliant mixing and sounds from the venues. For your first taste of the White Isles musical direction, this year, download, kick back and listen. Remember all was recorded live, no studio mularky. This is the real deal. Please seed and leave your feedback. Sorry no track listing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d86f85f3502b1f89646ab52957999569ae3560df","amp;dn":"%2A%2AIbiza+Live+Mix+2008%2A%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d86f85f3502b1f89646ab52957999569ae3560df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,111,133,243,80,43,31,137,100,106,181,41,87,153,149,105,174,53,96,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
