But somehow he has done it. The funny (ironic?) thing is that Mark doesn&amp;#039;t have that voice that says &quot;I am a rock singer&quot;. I don&amp;#039;t know how else to put that. It&amp;#039;s supposed to be a compliment, but you&amp;#039;d have to listen to it to know that. He has a Dave Matthews, Jack Johnson, Jack White kinda voice. You know what I mean? If you didn&amp;#039;t know they were actually professional singers, and you just heard their voice you might say &quot;Boy, they don&amp;#039;t sound like a typical singer; there is something very different about it; a little too high, or low, or raspy; certainly not perfect pitch.&quot; And Mark fits in that catergory. He is just a great singer. \nThe disc is Fantastic!!! I am not gonna be one of those that list every song with my thoughts on each, suffice it to say each is it&amp;#039;s own little story. And I always love trying to figure out which songs feature another member of Mark&amp;#039;s other band, Hootie and the Blowfish. Now we just need Soni&amp;#039;s debut. What? It&amp;#039;s only been 10 years in the making. :) \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRel. date .: Mar-14-2008     \n                             \nArtist ....: Mark Bryan      \nAlbum .....: End Of The Front\nGenre .....: Alternative     \n                             \nLabel .....: Artist Garage   \nCatalog # .: 8               \nLanguage ..: English         \n                             \nSource ....: CDDA            \nSize ......: 44,6 MB         \n\n\nMark Bryan - End Of The Front\n                             \n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                     \nNB   TRACKNAMES:                                          LENGHT:    \n                                                                     \n01.
