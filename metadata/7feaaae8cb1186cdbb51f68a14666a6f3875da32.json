She&amp;#039;s lived as the daughter of a \nlegend and had her family chronicled in Hollywood films (Walk the Line).\nShe&amp;#039;s seen the dark side of fame and struggled with addiction, all the while\nholding onto the grace and class emboldened deep family roots. Inspired by \nher life experiences, &amp;#039;Stronger&amp;#039; is a raw but touching recollection of her \nlife of the past few years. Years that included the wrenching sorrow of the\nsudden death of her stepfather, mother, sister and ex-lover. Also in that \nsame year she experienced the euphoria of meeting and falling in love with \nthe cowboy of her dreams. On her latest work &amp;#039;Stronger,&amp;#039; family roots have \nintertwined with her musical roots, seeing Carlene return to Tennessee to \nrecord and prompting her to work closely with brother John Carter Cash. Her \nrecent emotional peaks and valleys have also inspired Carlene to write the \nbulk of the material on Stronger, making for her most honest, real and \nmoving work to date. \n \n\nInformation Disc:\n?
