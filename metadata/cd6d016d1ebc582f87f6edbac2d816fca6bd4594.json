Though Dance Club Massacre draws influence from bands like The Locust, An Albatross, Daughters, Converge, Horse the Band,Fantomas,\nPig Destroyer and Between the Buried and Me they maintain a unique,\nlight hearted vibe that is absent from the genre.\n\nDance Club Massacre s lyrical themes primarily focus on horror movies,\npartying, girls, beer and generally having fun and enjoying life.\n\nSamples AT Myspace:\n\nHere you go, Enjoy iT","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd6d016d1ebc582f87f6edbac2d816fca6bd4594","amp;dn":"Dance+Club+Massacre+-+Feast+Of+The+Blood+Monsters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd6d016d1ebc582f87f6edbac2d816fca6bd4594","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,109,1,109,30,188,88,47,135,246,237,186,194,216,22,252,166,189,69,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
