Pretty ironic, I&amp;#039;ve always thought, because one of his last songs, &quot;Little One&quot; was written to his daughter in which he says, &quot;I will always be there.&quot;  And then he blows his brains out -- accidentally people insist, and it seems believable that he was just careless.\n\nIt&amp;#039;s also the last album with long-time producer James William Guercio.  Which seems okay because the sound was pretty much played by this time.  Elektra Glide in Blue didn&amp;#039;t help, either.\n\nOn this album:\n\nMississippi Delta City Blues\n\nBaby, What a Big Surprise\n\nTill the End of Time\n\nPoliceman\n\nTake Me Back to Chicago\n\nVote For Me\n\nTakin&amp;#039; It On Uptown\n\nThis Time\n\nThe Inner Struggle of a Man\n\nPrelude (Little One)\n\nLittle One\n\nWish I Could Fly\n\nParis\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf9aa410e4fa60f4836b22783602a36b1fc58f1d","amp;dn":"Chicago+XI+%2811%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf9aa410e4fa60f4836b22783602a36b1fc58f1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,154,164,16,228,250,96,244,131,107,34,120,54,2,163,107,31,197,143,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
