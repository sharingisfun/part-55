I can listen to the whole album without wanting to skip any song. The title track &quot;One Ride in Vegas&quot; is a wonderful rodeo song and I think that his cover of   &quot;That&amp;#039;s How I Got to Memphis&quot; is the best track on the album. &quot;Friends Don&amp;#039;t Drive Friends&quot; certainly should have gotten more airplay. But for a sentimental, sad song &quot;This Ol&amp;#039; World (Keeps Turning on Me)&quot; is a real winner. I also appreciate the fact that he writes most of his own stuff. \n\n1996 mp3 320vbr\n\ntrack list\n\n01-Friends Don&amp;#039;t Drive Friends\n02-That&amp;#039;s How I Got To Memphis\n03-Movin&amp;#039; Out To The Country\n04-Stayin&amp;#039; Is The Only Way To Go\n05-Somethin&amp;#039; Like That\n06-This Ol&amp;#039; World Keeps Turning On Me\n07-One Ride In Vegas\n08-13 WMZ\n09-I Can Love You\n10-That&amp;#039;s Just me","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cce4ed8a8b06a82ee09dced0c39cfa14c37f69e8","amp;dn":"Deryl+Dodd-One+Ride+In+Vegas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cce4ed8a8b06a82ee09dced0c39cfa14c37f69e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,228,237,138,139,6,168,46,224,157,206,208,195,156,250,20,195,127,105,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
