So keep in mind, that none of the projects here, is to bring piracy, but to make people get familiar with OSX, and later to buy original MACs. There is no way you can make everything work perfect as Apple do not release/license OSX for 3rd party distribution and installation on other hardwares other than its own in the near future? SO, the real feeling of MAC will come with real MAC. There is no guarantee that Apple will let OSX being installed the way it is right now forever. So treat these OSX versions as a demo into real MAC world, not main intention of piracy.[/quote]\n\nHow to install Leo easy and fast with iAtkos v1.0i r3 - NForce Edition or Kalyway 10.5.2 DVD, Newbies Guide + Install Guide (Intel CPUs Only Guide)\n\n[url]http://forum.insanelymac.com/index.php?showtopic=87901[/url]\n\nI did download this from RapidShare for 2 days even using 3 different PC&amp;#039;s!!!\nThat sucks!!!\n\n\n\nThat&amp;#039;s why I&amp;#039;m uploading it here - so others wouldn&amp;#039;t have to waste their time.\nI have decent upload speed - so it should spread pretty fast :)\n\nI did include md5 for it too\nMD5 = 3F3D063873469A5357F392D027843C10\n\nif somebody want&amp;#039;s to get it from RapidShare - here&amp;#039;s link:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1965acd108a60ad64bf82958f1923e093fece6e9","amp;dn":"iAtkos+v1.0i+r3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1965acd108a60ad64bf82958f1923e093fece6e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,101,172,209,8,166,10,214,75,248,41,88,241,146,62,9,63,236,230,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
