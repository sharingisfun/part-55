Lenti was supplanted by Max Cipicchia. Perhaps one of the more impressive Italian Metal bands to have emerged in the mid 80&amp;#039;s. Astaroth (Ita), fronted by the confident vocals of Bob Cattani, impressed the Dutch label Rave On Records enough to obtain a contract leading to the release of a mini album entitled &amp;#039;The Long Loud Silence&amp;#039; in 1985. A demo tape billed as &amp;#039;U.S.A.&amp;#039; arrived in 1988.\n\nAstaroth (Ita) - The Long Loud Silence\n\nEP, Rave on Records\n1985 \t\n[add review] \t\nLine-up:\nBob Cattani - vocals\nMax Cipicchia - guitar\nSimone Triscari - guitar\nShining - bass\nGiovanni Onofri - drums\n1.\tDie to be Alive\t05:50\t\n2.\tBurning the Diamond\t04:23\t\n3.\tJack in the Box\t05:03\t\n4.\tShe-Wolf\t04:39\t\nTotal playing time\t19:55\n\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94170552dfc7591dd787d2add78d3949fdf8583b","amp;dn":"Astaroth+-+1985+-+The+Long+Loud+Silence+%28It%29+-++80s+Geophagus+se","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94170552dfc7591dd787d2add78d3949fdf8583b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,23,5,82,223,199,89,29,215,135,210,173,215,141,57,73,253,248,88,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
