Kennedy Montgomery is a libertarian that you may recognize from 90's MTV, Stossel, and the Independents.\r\n\r\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\r\n\r\nIt's Hillary Clinton's birthday and Lincoln Chaffe has given her quite the gift. He dropped out. Katy Perry is handing out gifts, too. Turns out she loves Hillary. There's a selfie and everything.\r\n\r\nA super PAC is spending 1 million dollars in an effort to soften Hillary's image. Are they underestimating the amount of money they'll need? Tonight's party panel is here to discuss - BEN KISSEL, MEGAN MCCAIN, JOANNE NOSUCHINSKY. With Ben Carson surging in the polls Donald Trump is on the attack. Amy Shumer and her cousin senator Chuck Shumer have launched what they've called &quot;a crusade on guns&quot;.\r\n\r\nJUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO is here to talk about the recent Benghazi hearing and Hillary's demeanor as well as responses during it. Misleading statements, purgatory, the FBI, and Congress.\r\n\r\nTOPICAL STORM\r\n\r\nThe panel returns! First up - Jeb Bush has let loose. &quot;I've got a lot of better things to do than sit around and be demonized.&quot; Is Halloween just for kids or should adults join in too? The WHO has came out against hot dogs and bacon. They think they cause cancer. Our panel says, &quot;Who cares?&quot;.\r\n\r\nBRIAN BRENBERG of Kings College is here to talk about inequality. What are the real sources and how do we fix it?\r\n\r\nNightcap: The Texas Lawhawk, BRYAN WILSON, creator of one of the best lawyer ads ever is here via satellite.\r\n\r\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\nComplete name                            : Kennedy.2015.10.26.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\r\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\r\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\r\nCodec ID                                 : isom\r\nFile size                                : 252 MiB\r\nDuration                                 : 42mn 3s\r\nOverall bit rate                         : 839 Kbps\r\nWriting application                      : Lavf56.25.101\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nID                                       : 1\r\nFormat                                   : AVC\r\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\r\nFormat profile                           :   \r\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\r\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\r\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\r\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\r\nDuration                                 : 42mn 3s\r\nBit rate                                 : 700 Kbps\r\nWidth                                    : 624 pixels\r\nHeight                                   : 352 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\r\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\r\nMinimum frame rate                       : 7.493 fps\r\nMaximum frame rate                       : 29.970 fps\r\nColor space                              : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\r\nScan type                                : Progressive\r\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.106\r\nStream size                              : 211 MiB (83%)\r\nWriting library                          : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\r\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=700 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nID                                       : 2\r\nFormat                                   : AAC\r\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\r\nFormat profile                           : LC\r\nCodec ID                                 : 40\r\nDuration                                 : 42mn 3s\r\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\r\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\r\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\r\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\r\nStream size                              : 38.5 MiB (15%)\r\nLanguage                                 : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05ca7cecd8f4c5f62241b55069c1bf3d3afddac5","amp;dn":"Kennedy.2015.10.26.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05ca7cecd8f4c5f62241b55069c1bf3d3afddac5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,202,124,236,216,244,197,246,34,65,181,80,105,193,191,61,58,253,218,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
