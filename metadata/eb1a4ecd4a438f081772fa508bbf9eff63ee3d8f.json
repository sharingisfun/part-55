The second performance repeats most of the material from the first, so listeners can compare renditions of some fine repertoire such as &quot;It&amp;#039;s All Right with Me,&quot; &quot;Ill Wind,&quot; and &quot;Moonlight in Vermont,&quot; noting the subtle shifts and rearrangements that were a key part of Fitzgerald&amp;#039;s art. The CD concludes with two tunes accompanied by one of those massed ensembles of celebrated players that the JATP was famous, or notorious, for. This one includes eight horns, among them Lester Young, Coleman Hawkins, Stan Getz, Illinois Jacquet, and Flip Phillips on tenor saxophones, providing the CD with a raucous send-off.\n\nTrack 1-9 recorded in the stereo September 29, 1957 at the Chicago Opera House.\nTrack 10-18 recorded in mono, October 7, 1957 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.\n\nPersonnel:\nTrack 1-16 \nOscar Peterson - piano\nHerb Ellis - guitar\nRay Brown - bass\nJo Jones - drums\n\nTrack 17-18\nRoy Eldridge -trumpet\nJ.J.
