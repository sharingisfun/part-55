It&amp;#039;s a fascinating place, dotted with boisterous, crowded cities, rural seaside villages and active volcanoes. Three centuries of Spanish colonial rule left a lasting imprint on the architecture, food and culture of the Philippines, but native Filipino tradition thrives in locally brewed spirits like Lambanog, a distilled coconut wine made from the sap taken from the flowers of the palm tree. The national delicacy/fabled aphrodisiac, Balut, is fertilized duck embryo, fully developed in the shell, and then steamed, cracked open and consumed. With so many cultures constantly merging, so many cities rapidly changing, and so much natural beauty to behold, The Philippines is an ideal spot for the adventurous traveler.\n\n\nVisit: Malate\nVisit: Cart Noodle\nDrink: San Miguel Pale Pilsner\nVisit: Abas Bar &amp; Grill\nDrink: Cocoa-Vodka (flavored Lambanog)\nVisit: Hobbit House\nVisit: The Golden Tiger\nDrink: Pilsner Urquell (original Pilsner)\nVisit: Tayabas\nDrink: Lambanog\nVisit: Balaw Balaw Specialty Restaurant\nEat: Traditional Philippine dishes including: fried shrimp, frog legs, and caterpillars ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a061e4aee8ef248145ee57f543ced08dc1c38b3b","amp;dn":"Mojo+-+Three+Sheets+with+Zane+Lamprey+-+Season+2%2C+Episode+4+-+Ph","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a061e4aee8ef248145ee57f543ced08dc1c38b3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,97,228,174,232,239,36,129,69,238,87,245,67,206,208,141,193,195,139,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
