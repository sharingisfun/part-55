As you can see, this torrent contains everything possible regarding Journey's latest album Revelation, without any spam files or such. It took me a while to gather everything and organize it; I have two separate folders for a .flac rip (also uploaded here) and a .mp3 @320 rip (this torrent), which attributed to some of the delay. Please seed and help keep it alive; I'd really appreciate it. Thanks.\n\n\n-4RM0","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fecb16d61a91de6772406e14b7edfe2844565c7b","amp;dn":"%282008%29+Revelation-Journey%28MP3%40320%29%5BDVD-Rip%28DivX%2CAC3%40256%29%2C+Texts%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fecb16d61a91de6772406e14b7edfe2844565c7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,203,22,214,26,145,222,103,114,64,110,20,183,237,254,40,68,86,92,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
