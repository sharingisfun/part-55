Drawing material from the distaff side of country (June Carter, Jessi Colter), blues (Ma Rainey, Nina Simone), rock (Patti Smith), and folk (Joni Mitchell), in almost every case Moorer manages to bring something to the song (her stunning, soulful voice, to start with) while serving the spirit of the original. Her reworking of ?Ring of Fire,? a song that, as she notes, is about the passion and throes of falling in love, is curiously inert, but she nails Smith?s oft-covered take on the same topic, ?Dancing Barefoot,? and follows with a limpid, stately ?Both Sides Now,? an intense, loud-folk rendering of Julie Miller?s ?Orphan Train,? and an intimate, chamber music version of Kate McGarrigle?s ?Go, Leave.? And she has a voice that was born to sing songs like ?I Want a Little Sugar in My Bowl.?\n\n\nInformation Disc:\n\n? Artist:  Allison Moorer\n? Title:   Mockingbird\n? Year:    2008\n?
