When the Winnipeg-based Kreviazuk takes her show on the road, her audience stands listening in awe. An incredibly powerful debut, the pianist/vocalist provides lyrics both eloquent and cathartic in tracks like &quot;Grace&quot; (&quot;Please don&amp;#039;t go/without you I am weak/find myself drinking and sinking and seeking&quot;) and &quot;Wayne&quot; (&quot;It&amp;#039;s crowded and I&amp;#039;m lost in here/I&amp;#039;m trying to find a familiar fear&quot;). Kreviazuk&amp;#039;s music--as well as her piano playing--is rich, warm and beautiful.\n\n- amazon.com\n\n-----------------------\n\n\nIn a market glutted with young female singer/songwriters and female bandleaders, only the truly gifted will make a lasting impact. Foremost in that category is Canadian newcomer Chantal Kreviazuk, whose ample singing, writing, and piano-playing talents make this one of the most compelling debuts of the year. Featuring such brilliant cuts as the self-empowerment anthem &quot;God Made Me,&quot; the insightful &quot;Surrounded,&quot; the irresistibly catchy and provocative &quot;Co-Dependent,&quot; the insistent rocker &quot;Believer,&quot; and the touching &quot;Hands,&quot; &quot;Under These Rocks And Stones&quot; is a showstopper that plays flawlessly from start to finish and visits many musical areas along the way. The possibilities are infinite.\n\n\n- billboard.com\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b594824806310d760c6a487597eb52830b7946b","amp;dn":"Chantal+Kreviazuk+-+Under+These+Rocks+And+Stones+%5B1997%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b594824806310d760c6a487597eb52830b7946b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,89,72,36,128,99,16,215,96,198,164,135,89,126,181,40,48,183,148,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
