They were formed in the late 1970's in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, when singer Annie &quot;Holly&quot; Woods met guitarist Brian Allen. The band's constantly shifting line-up was originally augmented by guitarist/backing vocalist Sharon Alton, keyboardist Scott Kreyer, bassist Nick Costello, and drummer Jimmy Fox.\n\nRip from CD @ 320 kbps\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5570c1928d2f39c4b29fa7b502bfeff8ef2fa949","amp;dn":"Toronto+-+Lookin%5C%27+For+Trouble+%281980%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5570c1928d2f39c4b29fa7b502bfeff8ef2fa949","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,112,193,146,141,47,57,196,178,159,167,181,2,191,239,248,239,47,169,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
