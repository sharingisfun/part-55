I took all the PDF&amp;#039;s, converted them to JPG&amp;#039;s and packed them into CBZ&amp;#039;s so they could be read by the various comic viewers out there (CDDisplay, ComicRack, etc.) I also broke it up by the decades so it would be easier to download than the original 5 gig download.\n\nAll credit for this goes to the original uploader and/or scanner. I just did the conversion from PDF to JPG and packed them. Of course I did this over 450 times. :)\n\n*Note\nI have done all the decades, I just started with this one as it was requested.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd295ec43a03d4bcd661231e64448c3bd3e3ba3a","amp;dn":"A+Decade+of+the+X-Men+-+The+2000%5C%27s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd295ec43a03d4bcd661231e64448c3bd3e3ba3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,41,94,196,58,3,212,188,214,97,35,30,100,68,140,59,211,227,186,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
