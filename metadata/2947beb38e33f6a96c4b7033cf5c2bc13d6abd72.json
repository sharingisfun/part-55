If your XBMC Directory is\n   elsewhere you must change its Application Path by editing the .cfg file !! \n   Rename the &quot;ShortCut for -C-Drive.cfg&quot; and the &quot;ShortCut for -C-Drive.xbe&quot;\n   to something your BIOS can boot (evoxdash.xbe + evoxdash.cfg) + copy both\n   files to the ROOT of your -C-Drive.\n   !! Double check !! you did everything right then reboot - Voila ! \n\n.:...............................................................................:.\n ^                                                                               ^\n   RELEASE NOTES:\n\n   None.\n\n.:...............................................................................:.\n ^                                                                               ^\n   CHANGELOG:\n\n   These are the topmost 3 lines of the changes included in this Release.   \n   You can find the complete Changelogs in /docs/Changelog.txt.\n   \n   2008-06-03  13383  fixed: Video information window had missing info for tvshows\n                             + episodes (and possibly other stuff) if invoked from\n                             files view.\n   2008-06-03  13382  Changed : PM3 - Various Changes to Video Info dialog window\n                                including * Added Path to Movies info so you can\n                                tell what your original file is called and located\n                                * Added Number of Watched and Unwatched Episodes to\n                                TV Show info * Moved trailer button down to\n                                underneath the other buttons instead of being all\n                                out by itself * changed the code that referenced\n                                the icons in the window\n   2008-06-03  13381  Added : PM3 - Unwatched episode count to TV Shows\n                              &quot;Media Info 2&quot; view\n\n.:...............................................................................:.\n ^                                                                               ^\n   THANKS:\n\n   All the XBMC developers !!\n   This Software makes the XBOX worth soOo much more for all of us !\n   Everyone contributing to the scene !\n\n.:...............................................................................:.\n ^                                                                               ^\n   PS:\n\n   Enjoy &amp; Please Seeeeed !\n\n.:...............................................................................:.\n :                                                                               :\n : For Budget Reasons, the Light at the End of the Tunnel had to be switched Off :\n :                                                                               :\n.:...............................................................................:.\n ^ GasGiver                        Ã‚Â°04.05.2007Ã‚Â°                         GasGiver ^","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2947beb38e33f6a96c4b7033cf5c2bc13d6abd72","amp;dn":"03.Jun.2008.XBMC.XBOX.MediaCenter.2.0.GasGiver","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2947beb38e33f6a96c4b7033cf5c2bc13d6abd72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,71,190,179,142,51,246,169,108,75,112,51,207,92,43,193,61,106,189,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
