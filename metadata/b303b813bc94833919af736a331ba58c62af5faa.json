In between you learn something about the nasty symbolic of swords in the hands of old statues.\n\nThen I cover again the area of layer masks. I try to clarify the blunder I have made in the last episode and show you a (for me) new way to colourize a layer with the bucket fill tool. If you have read the comment from David Gowers for the last show you?ll know what I am talking about.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b303b813bc94833919af736a331ba58c62af5faa","amp;dn":"Meet_the_Gimp_Videopodcast_Episode_040","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b303b813bc94833919af736a331ba58c62af5faa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,3,184,19,188,148,131,57,25,175,115,106,51,27,165,140,98,175,95,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
