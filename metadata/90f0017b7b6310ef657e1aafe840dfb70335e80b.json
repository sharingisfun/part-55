They have lain lower and lower to protect their doctor, Simon Tam (Sean Maher), and his telepathic traumatized little sister, River (Summer Glau), from the alliance, whom he rescued her from a year earlier.

She then mutters \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Miranda\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; and goes berserk and nearly shoots Capt. Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), until her brother says the safety word to put her to sleep. Reynolds decides to take them back on board for safety, only now an alliance operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is on their tracks and making Reynolds determined to find out what \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Miranda\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; is and what the Alliance is hiding.\nRating: Rated PG-13 for sequences of intense violence and action, and some sexual references.\nRuntime: 119 min\n\n[img][/img]I noticed that there were  a few Serenity rips but not the aXXo rip and I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;ve seeded now close to 100 copies + and thought I would upload it here.
