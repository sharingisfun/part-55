Until last night, we couldn\\&amp;#039;t, but Who\\&amp;#039;s Your Monkey, a.k.a. Throwing Stars, had the theater cracking up! We are ready to see it again to catch any lines we may have missed while laughing during the movie. Not a big-budget movie but makes up for that in the writing and cast. Well done... Smart, Funny, Edgy, Dark Comedy! The soundtrack was surprising and fun, and added to the comedy of the film. The movie is very fast-paced and leaves you satisfied about what is in store for the characters\\&amp;#039; future. The cast had a really nice chemistry and you believed they had known each other for years. The new title and trailer give the idea that this is a silly, fluffy film, when in reality it has many layers, much depth, and great character development. If you see any Indie this year, this is the one!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bc58d4fc9f8e2fa27ccbd5d254fcb026d5dd7b6","amp;dn":"WYM+-+Copy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bc58d4fc9f8e2fa27ccbd5d254fcb026d5dd7b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,197,141,79,201,248,226,250,39,204,189,93,37,79,203,2,109,93,215,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
