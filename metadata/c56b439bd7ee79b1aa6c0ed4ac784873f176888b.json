This release comes off of the Profile Records label which was based out of New York City - hence this groups name, &amp;#039;Escape From New York&amp;#039;. It still surprises me how an American group on hip-hop label was able to carbon copy that authentic eurodisco sound across the ocean.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c56b439bd7ee79b1aa6c0ed4ac784873f176888b","amp;dn":"Escape+from+New+York+-+Save+Our+Love+%28extended+version%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c56b439bd7ee79b1aa6c0ed4ac784873f176888b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,107,67,155,215,238,121,177,170,108,14,212,172,120,72,115,241,118,136,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
