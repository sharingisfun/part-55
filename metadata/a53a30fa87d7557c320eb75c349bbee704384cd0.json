Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot;politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\r\n\r\nGuest: Judah Friedlander\r\n\r\nEpisode 270: Anthony is late today so TACS starts with Gavin McInnes filling in and telling us about traffic issues, washing habits, T-Pain and Kevin Hart, competition with Nick DiPaolo, and Rick Shapiroâ€™s antics. Anthony makes it in studio and talks about taping for the upcoming Patrice Oâ€™Neal documentary, the guys chat about Patriceâ€™s fearlessness, old Bill Burr clips, apology tours, dude versus chick drama, and married sex. After Gavin makes his exit, Judah Friedlander joins TACS to discuss the way TV and movie watching has changed, actors keeping side jobs, movie reboots, syfy flicks, product placement, special effects, and Judah tells us how he became interested and got into the industry. The guys reminisce on old gigs, chat about getting â€œrecognized,â€ Judahâ€™s new book and The New Yorker ripping him off, they share Patrice Oâ€™Neal and Jim Norton stories, and talk about bringing seriousness into comedy. They also get into gun control, the importance of having open debates and learning from other points of view, diversity in comedy, â€œfree hugs,â€ free speech, religion entering the ring, charity within communities, peopleâ€™s lack of thinking, the depth in social media, and attempted tactics in changing opinions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a53a30fa87d7557c320eb75c349bbee704384cd0","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-11-23+Judah+Friedlander+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a53a30fa87d7557c320eb75c349bbee704384cd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,58,48,250,135,215,85,124,50,14,183,92,52,155,190,231,4,56,76,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
