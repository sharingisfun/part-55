It&amp;#039;s free. If I can get 600 people to pay $2 plus shipping for it, I can publish it as a digipak print copy and still have 400 copies to give away, but I just want to get the music out to the world now. \n\nThis music is very different from traditional rock or metal. It&amp;#039;s closest to noise rock. I call it zombie rock. It&amp;#039;s heavily loop-based, the songs are all short (few run above 30 seconds) and repetitive. The CD has 98 different songs; my home-made pressings have Swarming twice to make this a full 99 songs. Rudimentary liner notes are in the .zip in both Microsoft Word and OpenOffice format. Two of the songs have their audacity source included to allow for remixes.\n\nMy music teacher plays this music at full blast in his car to annoy people who play bassy music. Even if you don&amp;#039;t listen to this music and enjoy it (though I expect that you will) it stil has utility.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13160e252e6a6779dc895d70a7148fdb72a699b9","amp;dn":"Four+Zombies+and+a+Clown+-+The+CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13160e252e6a6779dc895d70a7148fdb72a699b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,22,14,37,46,106,103,121,220,137,93,112,167,20,143,219,114,166,153,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
