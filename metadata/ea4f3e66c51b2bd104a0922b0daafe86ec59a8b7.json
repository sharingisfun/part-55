Showcasing the band at the very start of their ?classic? period, recorded several days before the landmark ?Number of the Beast? album was released, this excellent concert features almost the entire album amidst the best songs from the first two albums, all given a new perspective with Dickinson?s operatic vocals. He hasn?t quite established the familiar air siren wail just yet, but that?s what makes this early material all the more interesting, especially when compared to 1985?s definitive ?Live After Death.? This remains the final recording to feature drummer Clive Burr. The concert was also recorded on film under the same title, and can now be found on ?The History of Iron Maiden part 1: The Early Days? DVD, which is also great.\nThe band?s early sound is captured perfectly here, as are the hints of the epic heavy metal monster Iron Maiden would become, with the lengthy classic ?Hallowed Be Thy Name? setting the template for pretty much every album-closing track forever afterward. Everything is played precisely, but with enough cute errors to authenticate the performance; it?s just a shame that the set-list here is almost exactly the same as that on the BBC Archives. Highlights include the cool opener ?Murders in the Rue Morgue,? the ever-reliable ?Phantom of the Opera? and the entire performance of the ?Number of the Beast? material, wisely omitting the two weakest songs and even performing the B-side ?Total Eclipse,? which was later added to re-releases of the album anyway.\nIron Maiden&amp;#039;s 1982 &amp;#039;Beast On The Road&amp;#039; tour has taken on a mythical quality among Metal fans as the tour and the album which really put Maiden at the forefront of Rock and Metal worldwide. The historical show from the Hammersmith Odeon has been specially mixed and co-produced for the casket by Steve Harris and the band&amp;#039;s long serving sound engineer Doug Hall. This double CD clearly illustrates how remarkable and ground breaking the tour was in support of the all time classic album, &amp;#039;The Number Of The Beast&amp;#039;. The accompanying inlay booklet is a complete recreation of the &amp;#039;Beast On The Road&amp;#039; tour programme and lists all the world tour dates and includes notes from the band written at that time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea4f3e66c51b2bd104a0922b0daafe86ec59a8b7","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+Beast+Over+Hammersmith+CD2+%282002%29+%28Eddie%5C%27s+Arch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea4f3e66c51b2bd104a0922b0daafe86ec59a8b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,79,62,102,197,27,43,209,4,160,146,43,13,170,254,134,236,89,168,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
