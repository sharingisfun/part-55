In order to do this \r\n\r\nsafely, all seven chakras must be completely open and unobstructed.In order to \r\n\r\nhandle a large amount of bioelectricity safely, one's body must be strong and all \r\n\r\nof the seven chakras must be fully open.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome examples of bioelectricity include:\r\n\r\nBuddhist monks, who sat motionless in the street, (protesters), were soaked with gasoline and lit on fire. They continued to sit still and burn to death. \r\n\r\nMartial artists: busting through concrete with their fists, knife hand &quot;karate chop,&quot; enduring major, crushing, and lethal blows, unharmed. \r\n\r\nDim Mak: the deadly martial art of inflicting light specific blows to chi (a variation of bioelectricity) meridians (acupressure points of bioelectric energy flow) during specific times that can cause delayed death, sometimes up to five months later. \r\n\r\nWhen the mind, through fear, panics, or when one is in a life and death situation, this sometimes enables an individual to lift extremely heavy objects, for example, back end of a car, that under normal conditions, would be impossible. \r\n\r\nTelekinesis- The ability to move objects with the mind \r\n\r\nPyrokinesis- The ability to set things on fire with the mind \r\n\r\nElectrokinesis- The ability to control objects, such as computers that run on \r\n\r\nelectricity \r\n\r\nLevitation- Some martial arts and yoga masters have the ability to levitate their \r\nbodies into the air.The strength of oneâ€™s bioelectricity is the foundation of all magickal success. Old spells with strange ingredients have little or nothing to do with the success of a magickal working, the success depends upon the strength of the mind and the aura [the bioelectrical field] that with proper focus and direction, will affect one's environment and others","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0636c03284e6238ff9e40c18c6a187e11611021f","amp;dn":"The+Chakras+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0636c03284e6238ff9e40c18c6a187e11611021f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,54,192,50,132,230,35,143,249,228,12,24,198,161,135,225,22,17,2,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
