EZO, on the other hand, sounded like they grew up in Los Angeles, a city they came to call home in 1984 after recording two albums under the name Flatbacker (not reviewed here, but by several accounts these two albums are heavier and less mainstream than the EZO albums). The band was discovered by none other than Gene Simmons, who eventually produced the self-titled album. Both that album and the successful follow-up Fire Fire sounded distinctly American, opting squarely for a catchy hard rock/metal sound (likened by some to a heavier Kiss). Internal differences led to their breakup after the release of Fire Fire. Speaking of Loudness, two of the members here eventually joined that band.\n\n\n\nButcherboys","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:371a678ed2e12463c79548712d8e0c38874f5040","amp;dn":"EZO+-+Fire+Fire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"371a678ed2e12463c79548712d8e0c38874f5040","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,26,103,142,210,225,36,99,199,149,72,113,45,142,12,56,135,79,80,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
