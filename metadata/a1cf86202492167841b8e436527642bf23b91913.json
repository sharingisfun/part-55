All week, Sophie Raworth and former army officer Andy Torbet present from the Imperial War Museum in Duxford, Cambridgeshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  The War at Sea \r\nThere is a big surprise in store for special guest Si King from the Hairy Bikers in this episode, as he is presented with his late father's medal for his wartime service on the perilous Arctic convoys. Andy meets the last survivor of the midget submarine crew who assisted in crippling German battleship the Tirpitz, and two veterans from the Arctic convoys are reunited seventy years after serving together. There is a tribute to the military search and rescue helicopter teams from a Cornish resident who was rescued during the Boscastle floods. And there is a moving performance from the choir of the Duke of York's Royal Military School in Dover.\r\n\r\n2)  The Battle of Britain \r\nJournalist John Sergeant joins Sophie Raworth and former Army Officer Andy Torbet at the Imperial War Museum at Duxford in Cambridgeshire. The site was an important airbase during the Battle of Britain and John has a fascination with the heroic men and women who risked their lives in the skies. Former 'Spitfire Girl' Joy Lofthouse reminisces about her service delivering fighter planes to the frontline and flies a Tiger Moth at the age of 92. Veterans read the inspirational words of Churchill's wartime speeches and Andy meets a woman who worked in a Battle of Britain operations room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/75/The-People-Remember-Series-2-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f6/The-People-Remember-Series-2-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/58/The-People-Remember-Series-2-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d1/The-People-Remember-Series-2-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c9/The-People-Remember-Series-2-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/02/The-People-Remember-Series-2-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d3/The-People-Remember-Series-2-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8b/The-People-Remember-Series-2-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/26/The-People-Remember-Series-2-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/22/The-People-Remember-Series-2-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/18/The-People-Remember-Series-2-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f2/The-People-Remember-Series-2-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/04/The-People-Remember-Series-2-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d6/The-People-Remember-Series-2-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/bc/The-People-Remember-Series-2-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8e/The-People-Remember-Series-2-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3013 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 143 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 45mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1,005 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06nsc42","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1cf86202492167841b8e436527642bf23b91913","amp;dn":"BBC+The+People+Remember+Series+2+2of6+The+Battle+of+Britain+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1cf86202492167841b8e436527642bf23b91913","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,207,134,32,36,146,22,120,65,184,228,54,82,118,66,191,35,185,25,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
