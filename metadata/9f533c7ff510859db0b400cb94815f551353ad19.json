It stars Yusuke Iseya as Tetsuya Azuma/Casshern, Kumiko Aso as Luna Kozuki, Toshiaki Karasawa as Burai, Mayumi Sada as Saguree, and Jun Kaname as Barashin.\n\nOverview\n\nThe film is based on a 1973 anime television series, Shinz?ÃƒÂ¬ Ningen KyashÃƒâ€žÃƒÂ¼n (translated as &quot;Neo-Human Casshern&quot; and known as just Casshan in the United States) from animation studio Tatsunoko Productions. Along with contemporary films Able Edwards, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, Immortal, and Sin City, it was among the first feature-length live action films to be shot on a digital backlot, with the actors performing in front of a greenscreen and all but the simplest stage elements added digitally after the fact.\n\nThe Japanese release contains a 6.1 channel soundtrack (Dolby Digital 5.1 on the PAL Region 2 release[citation needed]) and English subtitles.\n\nThe theme song, &quot;Dareka no Negai ga Kanau Koro&quot;, was written and sung by the director&amp;#039;s then wife, Japanese pop singer Utada Hikaru.\n\nCasshern debuted on April 24th, premiering in fifth place with a total gross of $1,530,216 U.S.D in 181 theaters. Staying within the top ten for five weeks, the film went on to make under $13 million. The production cost was estimated at $6 million.\n\nIn 2004, Go Fish Pictures, the specialty division of DreamWorks, announced they had acquired the rights to Casshern. Although the official U.S. website states it&amp;#039;s coming soon to theaters, there has been no official date set since the announcement.\n\nThe DVD received an official Region 1 Release on October 16th 2007 and can be seen Here on Amazon.com. The US release is a full 24 minutes shorter than the original. It features both a Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby Digital stereo Japanese soundtrack, as well as English subtitles. The subtitles are almost universally criticized by fans for being enormously incomplete. On several occasions they are lacking entirely; when they do appear they often completely differ from the dialogue or oversimplify it to such a degree that key plot elements and the overall force of the story are diminished.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f533c7ff510859db0b400cb94815f551353ad19","amp;dn":"%5BBikkuri%5D+Casshern+%5BXvid+640+x+272%5D.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f533c7ff510859db0b400cb94815f551353ad19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,83,60,127,245,16,133,157,176,180,0,203,148,129,95,85,19,83,173,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
