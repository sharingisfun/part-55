The mathematician Maximillian Cohen (Sean Gullette) is tor-     ???\n???  mented by a severe migraine since he was a kid, and he uses     ???\n???  many pills to reduce his painful headaches. He is a lonely      ???\n???  man, and his only friend is his former professor Sol Robeson    ???\n???  (Mark Margolis). Max has the following assumptions, which       ???\n???  rules his life: (1) Mathematics is the language of nature;      ???\n???  (2) Everything around us can be represented and understood      ???\n???  from numbers; (3) If you graph the numbers in any systems,      ???\n???  patterns emerge. Therefore there are patterns everywhere in     ???\n???  nature. Based on these principles, Max is trying to figure      ???\n???  out a system to predict the behavior of the stock market. Due   ???\n???  to his research, Max is chased by a Wall Street company with    ???\n???  obvious interest in the results of his studies, and by an       ???\n???  orthodox Jew follower of the Torah, who believes that this      ???\n???  long string of numbers is a code sent from God.                 ???\n???                                                                  ???\n???                                                                  ???\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n???                              iMDB                                ???\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n???                                                                  ???\n???             &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138704&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138704&lt;/a&gt;                 ???\n???                                                                  ???\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n???
