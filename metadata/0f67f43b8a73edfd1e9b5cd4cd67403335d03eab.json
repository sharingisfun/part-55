It is also, for lack of a better word, a distinctly Japanese game, with numerous references to Shintou and other religions, and uses extensive Japanese wordplay.\n\nHowever, most who play it would hardly consider it a horror game. Most fans of Akai Ito love it because it is a (very) well written choose-your-own-adventure-style story, with a lovable lesbian main character who develops a relationship with one of five other lovable women, depending upon how you play.\n\nWhile the game obviously has many of the qualities you find in the Renai (romance) genre, Success Corp. describes it as a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Traditional Japanese Horror Adventure.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; While calling it \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Renai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; may be misleading (Kei is never clearly in a romantic relationship with the route character), calling it \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Horror\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; is probably also misleading (simply put, it isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;t scary). It does have some Horror qualities, though. Of the game\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s thirty-two endings, the Red Endings (or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;bad\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; endings) essentially mean that Kei is dead. The Blue Endings (or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;normal\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; endings) mean that she survived (although they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;re often more depressing than the Red Endings...).\n\nOne would be most accurate to simply call it a visual novel. It is a story about survival, because Kei has a special type of blood that attracts monsters that would suck her dry. However, first and foremost, the story is about the bonds that two people can form in a time of crisis.\n\nAt the beginning of the story, you learn that the main character suffered a terrible loss, very shortly before the story began. As you play through the routes, you will also see that each of the five women have had to deal with loss and loneliness in their lives, and have a void that needs to be filled.\n\nYou will also find a plethora of unique symbolism for each character, and numerous references to Japanese and interculteral mythologies. I hope you look forward to finding out what they are.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f67f43b8a73edfd1e9b5cd4cd67403335d03eab","amp;dn":"Akai+Ito+%5BCo2KY%5D%5BPS2%5D%5BJPN-NTSC%5D+by+as","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f67f43b8a73edfd1e9b5cd4cd67403335d03eab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,103,244,59,138,115,237,253,30,155,92,212,205,103,64,51,53,208,62,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
