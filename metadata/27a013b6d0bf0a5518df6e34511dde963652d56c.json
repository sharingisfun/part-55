It consists solely of cover songs, all originally recorded by male artists. It entered the UK album chart at number 1 and peaked in the US at number 11, spending 60 weeks on the Billboard 200 chart. It has since achieved double platinum status in both the UK and the US.\n\nThe album yielded four UK singles: &quot;No More I Love You&amp;#039;s&quot; (which entered the UK singles chart at number 2, Lennox&amp;#039;s highest ever solo peak), &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot;, &quot;Waiting in Vain&quot; and &quot;Something So Right&quot;.\n\nThe album was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the Grammy Awards of 1996, losing to Turbulent Indigo by Joni Mitchell, however, Lennox took home the Best Female Pop Vocal Performance award for her work on the first single &quot;No More I Love You&amp;#039;s&quot;.\n\nNo tour was held to promote this album, though Lennox played a one-off concert in Central Park, New York City in the fall of 1995.
