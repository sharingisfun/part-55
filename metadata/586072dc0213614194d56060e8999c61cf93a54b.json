Video files do not always work, for me the older video files could not convert, but the newer ones do. You must be running iTunes version 7.6.2 (the latest as of writing).\n\nA Java GUI is now included that can be used on both Windows and Mac machines. Just double click on the Requiem.jar file and the new GUI will come up.\n\nPlease use the README before running - otherwise, it won't work.  Since I have a PowerPC Mac, I had to read instructions on 'building' before getting it to work.\n\nHere's a modified version of the README (the last part is modified for clarity) when it comes for the PowerPC.\n\nNOTE: Previous Requiem users, I had to use step number 4 for this version versus previous versions.\n\n-------------------------\n\nTO BUILD:\n\n1. Install the developer tools (aka Xcode).  In particular, you'll need\n   make and g++.  The developer tools are available at\n      &lt;a href=&quot; http://developer.apple.com/tools/download/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://developer.apple.com/tools/download/&lt;/a&gt;\n   You don't have to download it, though - you can also install it from\n   the system disk that came with your computer.\n   You'll also need Java to build the gui.\n\n2. Open a terminal and 'cd' into the requiem directory.\n\n3. Type 'make'.\n\n4. If it says 'Nothing to be done for all,' or some other error message indicating it won't work, then type 'make distclean' and then type 'make' again.)\n\n-------------------------\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:586072dc0213614194d56060e8999c61cf93a54b","amp;dn":"Requiem+1.7+iTunes+DRM+Remover","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"586072dc0213614194d56060e8999c61cf93a54b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,96,114,220,2,19,97,65,148,213,96,96,232,153,156,97,207,147,165,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
