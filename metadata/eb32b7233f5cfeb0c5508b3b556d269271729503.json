It was the first game to be released by Square Co.Ã‚Â´s overseas development house, Square USA. In February 1996, Secret of Evermore saw release in the PAL territories of Australia and Europe. For the non-English-speaking market, it was translated into French, German, and Spanish.[1] The story follows a boy and his pet dog as they are inadvertently transported to a fantasy world created by an eccentric inventor. The gameplay shares many similarities with Secret of Mana, such as real-time battles, a ring-shaped menu system, and the ability to switch control between the characters. The player guides both the boy and his shapeshifting dog through Evermore, a world that is composed of separate realms, each resembling a different period of real-world history. Control can be passed between the two characters at will; the player will need to switch between the boy and the dog in order to solve various puzzles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb32b7233f5cfeb0c5508b3b556d269271729503","amp;dn":"Secret+of+Evermore+%5BPAL+-+Wii+-+VC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb32b7233f5cfeb0c5508b3b556d269271729503","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,50,183,35,63,92,254,176,197,80,139,59,85,109,38,146,113,114,149,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
