While dated and somewhat stagey, after all it *was* basically a filmed version of their hit Broadway show, it holds up better than many films of its day. Kaufman and Ryskind, who also wrote the stage show, wrote the screenplay with an eye to making the Marx Brothers wit appear spontaneous and natural. I remember how shocked I was when I first realized the boys were using a script!\n\nThe movie is laced with classics of Marxian comedy. The famous &quot;Why a duck?&quot; scene with Groucho and Chico (remember - it&amp;#039;s pronounced Chick-o, not Cheek-o, because he was such a womanizer), Groucho answering the telephone at the hotel&amp;#039;s front desk (Ice water? Ice water? Peel some onions. That&amp;#039;ll make your eyes water.) and Harpo shaking hands with the house detective while all of the hotel silverware falls out of his coat pockets.\n\nMargaret Dumont is priceless as the clueless matron. She claimed in later years it wasn&amp;#039;t an act; she really had no idea what the brothers were doing. Regardless, she is the ideal foil for the boys as they tear into &quot;polite&quot; society.\n\nTake a look at The Cocoanuts. You&amp;#039;ll see the wellspring from which all that Marx madness flows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimal Crackers (1930)\nadvertisement  photos   board   trailer   details  \n\nRegister or login to rate this title User Rating: 7.6/10 (4,087 votes) \nmore Photos (see all 24 | slideshow)  \n           \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverview\nDirector:Victor Heerman\n\nWriters:George S.

But once the good captain arrives, along with Spaulding&amp;#039;s stenographer Jamison (Zeppo), Signore Ravelli (Chico) and the Professor (Harpo), nothing sane or expected takes place afterwards. But really, what did you expect?\n\nPerfect foils are the likes of Dumont and art patron Mr. Chandler (Sorin), the latter of which is revealed to be Abie the Fish Peddler from Czechoslovakia by fellow Czech Chico. in fact, here&amp;#039;s a FAVORITE LINE: Chandler - (to Chico) &quot;Hey! How did you get to be Italian?&quot; Chico - &quot;Never you a-mind; who&amp;#039;s-a confession is-a this?&quot;. What&amp;#039;s not to love?\n\nAnyway, there&amp;#039;s loads of quotable dialogue, sight gags galore, a great running gag with a picture of a horse and a finale that must be seen to be believed.

Perelman, presents those four zany Marx Brothers in their third feature comedy. Following their previous efforts in THE COCOANUTS (1929) and ANIMAL CRACKERS (1930), each based on their 1920s stage works which were both filmed at Paramount&amp;#039;s Astoria studios in Long Island, NY, MONKEY BUSINESS, produced in Hollywood, became the team&amp;#039;s first original comedy and one of their most funnier outings. While no relation to the 20th Century-Fox 1952 comedy starring Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers, except in title only, and having nothing to do with monkeys, this presentation does get right down to business, however, when comedy is concerned.\n\nHere Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Zeppo play four stowaways aboard ship bound for the states who, after being discovered hiding in barrels and singing &quot;Sweet Adeline,&quot; they are pursued by First Officer Gibson (Tom Kennedy) and his crew, which finds the foursome running wild all over the ship, eluding authorities and driving practically everybody out of their minds. Eventually the four stowaways separate, with Chico and Harpo disguising themselves as barbers; Groucho posing as the captain and invade the sanctity of the captain&amp;#039;s quarters where he and Chico makes themselves at home by eating his meals; Harpo later chasing the young ladies as well as entertaining the little children during a puppet show while at the same time making a fool out of Gibson. Harpo even finds time to make friends with a frog, which he keeps under his hat. As for Zeppo, in between being chased, he finds time to escort a young lady named Mary (Ruth Hall) around the deck. Afterwards, they all encounter rival gangsters, such as Alkie Briggs (Harry Woods), who finds Groucho flirting with his wife, Lucille (Thelma Todd). Briggs, however, takes a liking to Groucho for proving his bravery by standing up to him, and offers him a job, along with Zeppo, as his personal bodyguards, while Chico and Harpo encounter another noted hood, Joe Helton (Rockcliffe Fellows), Mary&amp;#039;s father and Zeppo&amp;#039;s new love interest, and become his bodyguards as well. After the ship docks New York, the Marx Brothers find they must get past custom officials in order to get off, so after obtaining the passport belonging to the popular French entertainer, Maurice Chevalier (who does not appear), they pass themselves off as Chevalier by singing one of his current hit songs, &quot;You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me,&quot; but to no avail. How the silent Harpo gets by with this must be seen to be believed. While the story is not set entirely on board ship, the final 25 minutes or so shifts over to a swank party given by Kelton to introduce his daughter, Mary, to high society. The Marx Brothers join in the function with disfunctional tendencies, ranging from Groucho insulting the guests, Chico and Harpo entertaining with their traditional piano and harp interludes, as well as Briggs having his gang sneaking in, posing as musicians, and carring out his orders by kidnapping Kelton&amp;#039;s daughter, Mary, and holding her hostage in the barn in order to obtain ransom money for her release from her father, thus, leading Zeppo to act as hero and come to her rescue, while his fellow stowaway passengers Groucho, Chico and Harpo create havoc of their own.\n\nVirtually plotless in a sense, MONKEY BUSINESSS plays like an extended comedy short that would have worked equally well had it starred the Three Stooges. MONKEY BUSINESS is pure Marx Brothers nonsense that appears to be every bit as funny today as it possibly was way back in 1931. Anything goes with this film, including many memorable shipboard moments such as Groucho&amp;#039;s comedic dance with Thelma Todd; Groucho doing his bit by posing as a reporter interviewing and insulting the cultured Madame Pucchi (Cecil Cunningham, in a manner somewhat similar to Margaret Dumont, Groucho&amp;#039;s frequent foil and straightwoman). GROUCHO: &quot;Is it true you&amp;#039;re getting a divorce as soon as your husband recovers his eyesight? Is it true you wash your hair in clam broth? Is is true you used to dance in a flea circus?&quot; MADAME PUCCHI: &quot;This is outrageous! I don&amp;#039;t like this innuendo.&quot; GROUCHO: &quot;That&amp;#039;s what I always say. Love flies out the door when money comes innuendo.&quot;; the Chico and Groucho exchange regarding Christopher Columbus: GROUCHO: &quot;Columbus sailed from Spain to India looking for a short cut,&quot; CHICO: &quot;Oh, you mean a strawberry short cut?;&quot; Harpo coming out from a barrel of hay in the barn and seen kissing a calf, and much more.\n\nAs with most of the Marx Brothers films produced at the Paramount studio, MONKEY BUSINESS is pure comedy at best. Had this been done over at MGM, where the Marx Brothers would eventually themselves with their annually released comedies from 1935 to 1941, MONKEY BUSINESS would have been toned down some in comedy antics with extended romantic subplots and straight-forward and lengthy musical numbers. MONKEY BUSINESS has none of that. Unlike most Marx Brothers comedies, their characters in MONKEY BUSINESS have no background, no professions and no spoken character names (the closing cast credits them with their first names only). They are just unusual stowaways trying to keep themselves from being caught and taken to the brig. However, in this case, MONKEY BUSINESS has its full quota of belly-laughs. Nothing really drags and no scenes are unnecessary. And whatever scenes may not be of importance or interest to the viewers, it passes by very quickly.\n\nMONKEY BUSINESS, hailed as one of the top 100 comedies by the American Film Institute, has become a perennial favorite to many Marx Brothers enthusiasts. After many years being presented on commercial television on the afternoon or evening to after midnight hours, it became available on video cassette through MCA Home Video in the 1980s, and to cable television on several channels, from the Comedy Channel shortly prior to 1990, then to American Movie Classics from 1991 to 1992, and, ten years later, on Turner Classic Movies from December 2001 to November 2002. In spite of its age, MONKEY BUSINESS, for all its silliness, continues to bring laughter to a new generation of movie lovers whenever shown, thanks to those funny men billed as The Marx Brothers. Because of them, no ocean voyage would ever be the same again, which is why no self respecting ship should ever set sail without them either. Bon Voyage.\n\n\n\n\nHorse Feathers (1932)\n\n \n \n\nadvertisement  photos   board   trailer   details  \n\nRegister or login to rate this title User Rating: 7.7/10 (3,905 votes) \nmore Photos (see all 24 | slideshow)  \n           \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverview\nDirector:Norman Z.

You know the Marx brothers! Groucho, with his cigar, says something that sounds serious, but then makes it into a joke; Chico, with his Italian accent, mangles certain phrases, among other things; Harpo doesn&amp;#039;t speak but (literally) has all sorts of tricks up his sleeve; Zeppo actually is serious...to an extent. In this case, Quincy Wagstaff (Groucho) becomes dean of Huxley College and hopes to defeat rival college Darwin in a football game. He hires two goof-balls, Baravelli (Chico) and Pinky (Harpo), while the other college gets the real players.\n\nThe truth is that you don&amp;#039;t even have to understand the plot to have a good time. The movie is all about the Marx brothers&amp;#039; anarchic humor, particularly when Harpo causes a traffic jam and then plays a trick on a cop. The football game at the end is not like any game that you&amp;#039;ve ever seen. You&amp;#039;re sure to love the whole movie.

The puns, the insults, are all now comedy classics. The Lemonade Stand &amp; the Mirror Scenes also memorable. I hadn&amp;#039;t seen the movie in around 15 years but bought the DVD so my 15 year old son could experience the Marxes. He loved it too.\n\nWhat I noticed for the first time was the satire of society, manners, government, the military, the bureaucracy (including Roberts Rules of Order). I can&amp;#039;t recall any other comedy I&amp;#039;ve seen that satirizes on such a grand scale.\n\nFor Marx Brothers fans this is a must see. It&amp;#039;s the boys with no love story or musical interludes in the way.\n\nOne word for those who disagree- &quot;Upstart&quot;. :-) \n\n\n\n\n\nA Night at the Opera (1935)\nadvertisement  photos   board   trailer   details  \n\nRegister or login to rate this title User Rating: 8.0/10 (10,590 votes) \nmore Photos (see all 20 | slideshow)  \n           \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverview\nDirector:Sam Wood\nmore \nWriters:James Kevin McGuinness (story)\nGeorge S.

It has comedy, music, and a good cast - everything except Zeppo, who by this time had left the act. It fully deserves its reputation as one of the two best Marx Brothers films, along with &quot;Duck Soup&quot;.\n\n&quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; is probably slightly less funny than &quot;Duck Soup&quot; (it is no criticism to say that of any film), but it has more of a story to connect the great comic bits. There is a good supporting cast in both films - here Sig Ruman is especially funny, in addition to the perennial Margaret Dumont. It also has several fairly long musical interludes - some are operatic, but the most entertaining is Chico and Harpo&amp;#039;s impromptu shipboard entertainment.\n\nOf course, the real attraction in any of these films is the comedy, and there are some memorable bits in this one. The contract negotiations between Chico and Groucho, and the scene in Groucho&amp;#039;s stateroom, are especially hilarious, and you have to see the stateroom scene more than once to catch everything. And for sustained zany humor, the climactic sequence at the opera might be the funniest part of all.\n\nThis is certainly a must for Marx Brothers fans. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f98cd96f57d27fe941ebc75a28a5a4f1c81e2fd","amp;dn":"MARX+BOTHERS+1929+-+1935+.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f98cd96f57d27fe941ebc75a28a5a4f1c81e2fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,152,205,150,245,125,39,254,148,30,188,117,162,138,90,79,28,129,226,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
