It includes everything needed to play, and includes the original unmodded beta and a particle editor for making your own particles to add to the game. I put this together myself and included my own mods. The website for it (includes forums for support and showing off what you make) is at http://www.thebettermod.org and is hosted by http://www.mix-networks.com\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7690f94d9f4675a2f0690835bf6d54aa29a7b0f7","amp;dn":"The+Orange+Block+1.4.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7690f94d9f4675a2f0690835bf6d54aa29a7b0f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,144,249,77,159,70,117,162,240,105,8,53,191,109,84,170,41,167,176,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
