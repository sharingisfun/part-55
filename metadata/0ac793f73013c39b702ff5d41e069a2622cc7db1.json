This one will fit on a CD and I can\\&amp;#039;t detect any decrease in quality.\n\nSynopsis from the Crude Impact web site.\n\nCrude Impact\n------------\n\nCRUDE IMPACT is a powerful and timely story that deftly explores the\ninterconnection between human domination of the planet and the\ndiscovery and use of oil. This documentary film exposes our deeprooted\ndependency on the availability of fossil fuel energy and\nexamines the future implications of peak oil ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ the point in time when\nthe amount of petroleum worldwide begins a steady, inexorable\ndecline. Journeying from the West African delta region to the heart of\nthe Amazon rainforest, from Washington to Shanghai, from early man\nto the unknown future, CRUDE IMPACT chronicles the collision of our\ninsatiable appetite for oil with the rights and livelihoods of indigenous\ncultures, other species and the planet itself. It is a thought-provoking\nstory filled with discovery, sorrow, outrage, humor and ultimately,\nhope.\n\nThe objective of the film is to promote positive, hopeful change in the way we source and use energy. Changes that will create a more just and sustainable world.\n\nPlease browse our site, see the film, and as Thom Hartmann so eloquently states, \\&quot;be an instrument of awakening\\&quot;.\n\n\n\n\nRun Time: 1 hr 38 minutes\n\n\nFor more information on or to purchase this film, please visit:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.crudeimpact.com/show.asp?content_id=9665&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.crudeimpact.com/show.asp?content_id=9665&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ac793f73013c39b702ff5d41e069a2622cc7db1","amp;dn":"Crude+Impact","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ac793f73013c39b702ff5d41e069a2622cc7db1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,199,147,247,48,19,195,155,112,47,245,212,30,6,154,38,34,204,125,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
