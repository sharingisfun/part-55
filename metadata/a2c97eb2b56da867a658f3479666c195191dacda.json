EMI America had dropped the singer after 1982&amp;#039;s career high point, Select, didn&amp;#039;t spawn any hits ÃƒÂ¢?? which is a shame since this admittedly uneven album is a key transition point in her career. Catch as Catch Can is probably Wilde&amp;#039;s most experimental album, a continuation of the dark-hued synth rock feel of Select with hints of the more commercial dance-pop sound that would characterize the rest of her career. Certainly the first single, the gimmicky, campy strut &quot;Love Blonde,&quot; is the oddest single of Wilde&amp;#039;s career. Elsewhere, the genuinely beautiful ballad &quot;Can You Hear It&quot; (probably the prettiest song Wilde ever recorded), &quot;Sparks,&quot; and the quirky &quot;Dream Sequence&quot; have an atmospheric, nearly psychedelic tinge, thanks to hazy backing vocals and diffused, dreamy arrangements. However, other songs like the opening &quot;House of Salome&quot; and the stuttering &quot;Back Street Joe&quot; point toward the purely electronic disco sound that would characterize 1984&amp;#039;s Teases and Dares, and indeed pretty much every Kim Wilde release thereafter. \n\nBonus Tracks:\n\n- Back Street Driver\n- Bitter Is Better \n- Love Blonde - 12&quot; version\n- Dancing In The Dark - 12&quot; Version\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2c97eb2b56da867a658f3479666c195191dacda","amp;dn":"Kim+Wilde+-+Catch+As+Catch+Can+%5BRemastered+Bonus+Tracks%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2c97eb2b56da867a658f3479666c195191dacda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,201,126,178,181,109,168,103,166,88,243,71,150,102,193,149,25,29,172,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
