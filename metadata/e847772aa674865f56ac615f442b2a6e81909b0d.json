It was filmed as the sixth and final part of the Love Cinema series consisting of six straight-to-video releases by independent filmmakers via a brief but exclusive run at the minuscule Shimokitazawa cinema in Tokyo. The six films were conceived as low budget exercises to explore the benefits afforded by the low-cost Digital Video medium such as the increased mobility of film and the low-lighting conditions available to the filmmakers.\n\nVisitor Q often replicates the style of documentary footage and home movies, which invokes a sense of realism that contradicts the filmÃƒÂ¢??s more bizarre elements and black comedy.\n\n[edit] Plot\n\nThe film&amp;#039;s plot is often compared to Pier Paolo Pasolini&amp;#039;s Teorema, in which a strange visitor to a wealthy family seduces the maid, the son, the mother, the daughter and finally the father before leaving a few days after, subsequently changing their lives.\n\nThe story focuses on a few days within a dysfunctional Japanese family. The father, a failed TV reporter, is having an incestuous affair with his prostitute daughter. In an attempt to turn his professional career around, he decides to make his son the main subject of his documentary on the hopelessness of youth. A punching bag for his classmates, the son deals with his troubles by beating up his mother. In turn, the mother turns to heroin and prostitution...\n\n\n[General]\nTitle:                 [Bikkuri] Visitor Q [Xvid 640 x 464]\nData source:           DVD\nDVD title number:      1\nRuntime:               01:45:08\n\n[Video]\nVideo format:          NTSC\nFPS:                   23.976\nSize:                  640 x 464\nVideo bitrate (kbps):  791\nVideo codec:           xvid4\n2-pass-encoded:        yes\nFast resizing:         no\nDeinterlacer filter:   \nAntialiasing filter:   No antialiasing\n\n[Audio 1]\nDVD audio track id:    0\nLanguage:              xx\nAudio codec:           mp3\nMP3 quality:           0\nChannels:              2\nSample rate:           48000\nAudio bitrate (kbps):  128\nVolume rescaling:      1.096\nAudio filter:          None, volume rescale only","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e847772aa674865f56ac615f442b2a6e81909b0d","amp;dn":"%5BBikkuri%5D+Visitor+Q+%5BXvid+640+x+464%5D.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e847772aa674865f56ac615f442b2a6e81909b0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,71,119,42,166,116,134,95,86,172,97,95,68,43,42,110,129,144,155,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
