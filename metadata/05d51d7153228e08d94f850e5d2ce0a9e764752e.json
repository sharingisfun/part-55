I thought I could do much better. This is the 480 encode. Here are a few of the problems I have:\n\n1) Their MP4 is using MPEG4 ASP (FFMPEG4), which is not all that efficient of a codec. Especially with HD content. And, AVI...use a modern container!!\n2) Their h.264 encodes use the QuickTime encoder, which is a very very poor implementation of h.264.\n3) Theora isn&amp;#039;t the greatest codec, but at least it&amp;#039;s open. But, stereo vorbis, why?\n4) MSMPEG4, why???????\n\nSo let me present my encode:\nContainer: Matroska\nVideo Codec: x264\nVideo Bitrate: 1509kbps\nAudio Codec: Nero HE-AAC\nAudio Bitrate: 221kbps\n\nFor the curious, here&amp;#039;s what settings I used:\nVideo was scaled from the 1080p source using the Bicubic Natural Spline scaler in libswscale. I used x264 r869 with the psyrdo patch applied.\n--keyint 240 --min-keyint 24 --pre-scenecut --bframes 16 --b-pyramid --ref 16 --crf 18 --partitions all --direct auto --weightb --me umh --subme 7 --b-rdo --mixed-refs --bime --8x8dct --trellis 2\n\nFor audio, I used the latest release of the Nero AAC Codec (version 1.1.34.2) at -q 0.25\n\nMy results, a file sized less than their lowest quality, but with much better visual quality, and full 5.1 channel surround.
