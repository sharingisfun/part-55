The climax and the combination of sounds on this tune made it an instant classic, played all over the World (including Brazil, where it&amp;#039;s part of DJ Yellow P.&amp;#039;s chart at Frank Afrika&amp;#039;s Dub floor on Sarajevo, Sao Paulo). This was the music whose vocals and cornette lines were sampled by DJ Hype on his &quot;Dub Plate Fever&quot; ninetie&amp;#039;s hit (the tune in question is on the other side of his 1994 Roll Da Beats EP on Suburban Base). If you ever have the chance to reach this original one, don&amp;#039;t miss it. You&amp;#039;ll be deeply touched by the contagious bass lines, the unforgetteable &amp; tipical Jamaican cornette sounds, as well as the soulful chanting &quot;Wooooowww Yeaaaahhh!&quot; on the end of the horn&amp;#039;s sequences.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b1673fd780d82389d41c1c24d957951f74d251b","amp;dn":"dennis+brown++the+promised+land","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b1673fd780d82389d41c1c24d957951f74d251b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,22,115,253,120,13,130,56,157,65,193,194,77,149,121,81,247,77,37,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
