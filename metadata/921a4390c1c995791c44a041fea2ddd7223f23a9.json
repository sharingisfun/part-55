White provided vocals, guitar, and piano, while Muldoon played on drums and created sounds with a worm gear saw.\n\n\n\nWhite grew up and lived in Detroit, Michigan. He originally was a drummer, but decided to take up guitar at age nineteen. White was in various other bands in the mid to late 1990&amp;#039;s such as Goober And The Peas, The Go, Two-Star Tabernacle, a brief stint with The Henchmen, and most prominently The White Stripes. White was an upholstering apprentice of Muldoon, a family friend. Muldoon was a drummer and they formed a band. The band was short-lived, however and only released one single.\n\n\n\n&quot;Makers Of High Grade Suites&quot; (SFTRI 611) was their only single, a 7&quot; record released on the Sympathy for the Record Industry label in 2000. The track listing (with the composer) is:\n&quot;Apple Of My Eye&quot; - (Jack White)\n&quot;I Ain&amp;#039;t Superstitious&quot; - (Willie Dixon)\n&quot;Pain (Gimme Sympathy)&quot; - (Jack Starr)\nThe songs were recorded at Third Man Studio and produced by White and Muldoon. Those tracks were then mixed at Ghetto Recorders in Detroit. The record itself came with a variety of inserts, such as a sticker for White&amp;#039;s business &amp;#039;Third Man Upholstery&amp;#039;, his own business cards, a &quot;fabric&quot; sample of sandpaper, a Muldoon Studio business card and a reproduction of an WE Klomp upholstery tag. The single was pressed in a limited amount and is highly collectable, selling for around $200 on eBay.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:921a4390c1c995791c44a041fea2ddd7223f23a9","amp;dn":"The+Upholsterers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"921a4390c1c995791c44a041fea2ddd7223f23a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,26,67,144,193,201,149,121,28,68,160,65,254,162,221,215,34,63,35,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
