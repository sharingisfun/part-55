That was never ending boring job. Of course, this process does not affect\nthe quality of my pictures, it is lossless.\nSo finally, we get lossless gallery from this game.\nOnce again: i guaratee that these are lossless pictures.\nI dont post sample picture here, because if you know this game, you should know the officer picture.\n\nI coded the program by myself, if someone is interesting in this, you can freely email me to: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;56253337783a39203325782f392316313b373f3a7835393b&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n*****************************\nThis is my first torrent maybe it does not work well.\n\nAnd my biggest problem is that: i am now using share internet connection with \nothers dudes. So I can not seed in daylight, I mean i am only seed this torrent \nfrom 3:00 AM - 8:00 AM (Osaka timezone, Japan, yes, when I and every one sleep. If you can tell those dudes sleep ealier, you \ncan download sooner). I will seed this as long as possible. So if you want to download, please wait until 3:00 AM (my time zone).\nPlease patient, I will seed at least someone get 100% and later.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1afef8cea73cdf7738a809919751793d87df47e","amp;dn":"Warriors+Orochi+Lossless+Officer+Gallery","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1afef8cea73cdf7738a809919751793d87df47e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,175,239,140,234,115,205,247,115,138,128,153,25,117,23,147,216,125,244,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
