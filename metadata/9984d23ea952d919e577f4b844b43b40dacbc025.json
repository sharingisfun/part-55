(For obvious reasons.)\n\n\nAbout WCG 2005:\nThe World Cyber Games 2005 was held in Singapore at Suntec Singapore International Convention and Exhibition Centre from 16 November to 20 November 2005. There were over 800 players from 67 countries. Over 39,000 spectators turned up at the games to cheer for the players. The grand prize for the game is US$435,000.\n\nGames played:\n    * Counter-Strike: Source\n    * FIFA Football 2005\n    * Need For Speed: Underground 2\n    * StarCraft: Brood War\n    * Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne\n    * Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Starcraft PRO-Gaming scene:\n\nAfter its release, StarCraft rapidly grew in popularity in South Korea, establishing a successful pro-gaming scene. Pro-gamers in South Korea are media celebrities. StarCraft games are broadcast over three television channels dedicated to the professional gaming scene. Pro-gamers in South Korea have gained television contracts, sponsorships, and tournament prizes, allowing the most famous player, Lim Yo-Hwan (known in-game as SlayerS `BoxeR`), to gain a fanclub of over half a million people. Professional gamers dedicate a lot of time playing StarCraft to prepare for the highly competitive leagues. Lee Yun-Yeol, a Terran player known as [Red]NaDa, reported earnings in 2005 of US$200,000.\n\n--\n\nThe computer game StarCraft has an active professional competition circuit, particularly in South Korea. The two major game channels in South Korea, Ongamenet and MBCGame, each run a Starleague, viewed by millions of fans. Starting in about 2002, pro-gamers started to become organized into teams, sponsored by large South Korean companies like Samsung, SK Telecom and KTF. StarCraft is also the most popular computer game competition during the annual World Cyber Games thanks to its Korean fanbase, and it is overall one of the world&amp;#039;s largest computer and video game competitions in terms of prize money, global coverage and participants.\n\nMore: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft_professional_competition\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE:\nFinally what weÃƒÂ¢??ve been waiting for! After 10 years of broadcasting games live on Korean television, Korean company GOMTV has decided to hire an English commentator to cover their games. No other than Tasteless, former progamer and commentator at previous events like WCG will be covering the games live from the studio along with the three Korean commentators. The games can be watched live streaming through their GOM Player or watched on their website.\nThere has been no professional coverage of Starcraft outside Korea except the yearly WCG and Blizzard. (And no other game for that matter) GOMTV have invested a huge amount of money on this, without knowing if there will be any audience. However, they have stated that they will continue delivering English coverage if it becomes a success. This could very well be the start of professional gaming outside of Korea. Please support GOMTV by going to their website and watching their games: http://www.gomtv.net/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9984d23ea952d919e577f4b844b43b40dacbc025","amp;dn":"World+Cyber+Games+2005-Starcraft%28National+Geographic+documentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9984d23ea952d919e577f4b844b43b40dacbc025","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,132,210,62,169,82,217,25,229,119,244,184,68,180,59,64,218,203,192,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
