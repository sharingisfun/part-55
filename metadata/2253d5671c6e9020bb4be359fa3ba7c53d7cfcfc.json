In December, he began putting together what he had planned\n\tto be a mixtape for his friends. A simple task, it seemed, but he failed.\n\n\tInstead of just mixing songs in a set, he found himself\tweaving all the \n\ttracks together, inspired by the collage aesthetics of band such as \n\tThe Avalanches and Saint Etienne. He began adding new elements where he \n\tthought the originals were lacking. People began dropping by the studio \n\tto record vocals and instruments over the loops and fragments he&amp;#039;d \n\textracted from the original tunes. Soon enough, the result had become \n\tsomething very different than just a generic mixtape.\n\n\t&quot;Frauds&quot; is neither mixtape nor album. It&amp;#039;s neither remix or mash-up. \n\tIt&amp;#039;s something in between it all, with a touch of ambient atmosphere \n\tadded. &quot;Frauds&quot; is built from elements ranging from Prince to The Rice \n\tTwins, from Nicolas Makelberge to Bryan Ferry, from Usher to Viktor \n\tSjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶berg, layered with field recordings and finalized in the late night \n\tsessions in Roth HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ndle Studio where the album... Sorry, the fraud was \n\tcompleted.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2253d5671c6e9020bb4be359fa3ba7c53d7cfcfc","amp;dn":"Mr.Suitcase+-+Frauds+%282008-MP3-320%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2253d5671c6e9020bb4be359fa3ba7c53d7cfcfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,83,213,103,28,110,144,32,187,75,227,89,250,59,167,197,61,124,252,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
