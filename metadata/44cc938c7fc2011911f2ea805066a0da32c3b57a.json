The film has been over-cropped to 1.33:1 FULL SCREEN, the image has been slightly bleached and additional grain has been added. There is even a fake &quot;tracking&quot; issue in the middle of the film! Captin Spaulding, Grandpa Hugo, Stucky, the Cops, and Denise&amp;#039;s father have all been removed from the film. The idea was to pace the film like an older horror flick. No more flashy cuts, outragous editing or over-the-top dialogue. It&amp;#039;s now a retro, old-skool horror flick.\n\nFor best results, after downloaded and burned onto DVD, transfer this edit to an old, worn VHS tape.\n\nIncluded with this download is the film in .vob format and VHS artwork.\n\nPOKE SOME SMOT AND SEEEEEEEEEEEEEED!\n\nFor more info., go to: w w w . f r e e w e b s . c o m / r e t r o h o r r o r r e m i x /\n\nWATCH FOR OTHER &quot;VINTAGE VHS EDITIONS&quot; IN THE NEAR FUTURE!\n\nFrom Your Friends At RETRO HORROR REMIX","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44cc938c7fc2011911f2ea805066a0da32c3b57a","amp;dn":"House+of+1000+Corpses+-+Vintage+VHS+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44cc938c7fc2011911f2ea805066a0da32c3b57a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,204,147,140,127,194,1,25,17,242,234,128,80,102,160,218,50,195,181,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
