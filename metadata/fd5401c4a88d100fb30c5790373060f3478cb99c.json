Their 10-year-old son Josh is playing cello -- beautifully, as usual. His younger sister looks up to him, and his parents are proud of their son. On the way home, they all stop at a gas station on Reservation Road. There, in one terrible instant, he is taken from them forever. On a warm September evening, law associate Dwight Arno and his 11-year-old son Lucas are attending a baseball game. Their favorite team, the Red Sox, is playing - and, hopefully, heading for the World Series. Dwight cherishes his time spent with Lucas. Driving his son back to his ex-wife, Lucas&amp;#039; mother Ruth Wheldon, Dwight heads towards his fateful encounter at Reservation Road. The accident happens so fast that Lucas is all but unaware, while Ethan -- the only witness -- is all too aware, as a panicked Dwight speeds away. The police are called, and an investigation begins. Haunted by the tragedy, both fathers react in unexpected ways, as do Grace and Emma. As a reckoning looms, the two fathers are forced to make the hardest choices of their lives.\n\n\n             ===== File Info  ===== \nFileSize           : 696M\nPlayTime           : 01:37:46.240\nVideoCount         : 1\nAudioCount         : 1\n              ===== Video Info ===== \nVideo 0# Stream\nVideoCodec         : XVID\nVideoWidth         : 640 pixels\nVideoHeight        : 336 pixels\nVideoFrameRate     : 25fps\nVideoFrameCount    : 146656\nVideoBitRate       : 0\n              ===== Audio Info ===== \nAudio 0# Stream\nAudioCodec         : MP3\nAudioBitRate       : 129360\nAudioChannels      : 2\nAudioSampleRate    : 48000\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd5401c4a88d100fb30c5790373060f3478cb99c","amp;dn":"Reservation.Road.LIMITED.DVDRip.XviD-DMT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd5401c4a88d100fb30c5790373060f3478cb99c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,84,1,196,168,141,16,15,179,12,87,144,55,48,96,243,71,140,185,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
