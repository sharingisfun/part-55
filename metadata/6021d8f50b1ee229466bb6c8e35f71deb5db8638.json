Much speculation surrounds the tombs, some say they hold invaluable treasure, while\n\nothers believe great wealth may be attained through the technology left behind by this advanced race.\n\nAs Beni, players enter the Caverns on a dangerous quest for riches. Along his strange journey, Beni encounters a sentinel charged with guarding the tombs. This sentinel, a holograph programmed with\n\nadvanced A.I., awakens only when the tombs are disturbed. She appears to Beni throughout his quest, sometimes with a benign purpose, but other times with calculated intentions. Beni will soon\n\nrealize that the sentinel is much more than she appears to be. Her dark purpose threatens his very existence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6021d8f50b1ee229466bb6c8e35f71deb5db8638","amp;dn":"Sentinel+Descendants+In+Time","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6021d8f50b1ee229466bb6c8e35f71deb5db8638","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,33,216,245,11,30,226,41,70,107,182,200,227,95,113,222,181,219,134,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
