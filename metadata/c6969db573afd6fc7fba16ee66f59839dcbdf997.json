Considering this full-scale, multi-prong assault â€” which also included a new album by Robert Plant, after all â€” it was probably not all that spontaneous. Such a precise attack suits this most mythic of classic rock groups, who always benefited from an enormous sense of scale. Weighing in at two discs and 24 tracks, Mothership has a sense of scale that the previous round of compilations â€” the two-part Early Days &amp; Latter Days, delivered in 1999 and 2000 respectively â€” lacked, not just because it pushes these two phases together but because it is heavy on the heavy epics, emphasizing Zeppelinâ€™s sheer sonic ballast over either their lighter or more idiosyncratic moments.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\nDisc #1/2\r\nâ€”â€”â€“\r\n01.
