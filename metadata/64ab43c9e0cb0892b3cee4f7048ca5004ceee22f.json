Best songs on here are The Job Song, Wake the Sun, and Bright Red Stone(Bright Red Stone is one of the best songs overall). Strangest thing on here is O&amp;#039;Death, which has amazing instrumentals and the worst vocalist I heard through 758 songs(not counting Wing, which was just confusing. You&amp;#039;ll get that later). Also, fair warning, there are a lot of mediocre vocals on here, and a lot of non-existant vocals on here. \n\n1.Gone-Lorrie Matheson\n2.Forest Fire-Matt Pickerel And His Praying Hands\n3.Bloody Mother ****ing ******-Martha Wainwright\n4.Wake the Sun-The Matches\n5.How Lucky We Are-Meiko\n6.The Job Song-Midtown Dickens\n7.Grand Solution-Miz Metro\n8.Skipping Stones-Mom\n9.My Girl, Suicide-Mr. Lewis And The Funeral 5\n10.2 Bodies, 1 Heart-Noah And The Whale\n11.Standing Here-Nosaprise\n12.Wednesday Morning-The Nymphettes\n13.Down to Rest-O&amp;#039;Death\n14.Truck-The Octopus Project\n15.Your Love Don&amp;#039;t Work Like Mine-Olga\n16.Treasure-Papercranes\n17.Filthy Rich Kids-Parkas\n18.Jesus Grow A Handlebar Mustache-Pataphysics\n19.Bright Red Stone-Paul Metzger\n20.Kolndombe-Pedro Martinez Ensemble\n21.Television-Peggy Sue and The Pirates\n22.Normal Illinois-Phonograph\n23.A Picture of Our Torn Up Praise-Phosphorescent\n24.California Is For ****ers-Pigeon\n25.Sugar Cinnamon-Portugal the Man\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64ab43c9e0cb0892b3cee4f7048ca5004ceee22f","amp;dn":"Best+of+The+SXSW+Playlist%2C+Part+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64ab43c9e0cb0892b3cee4f7048ca5004ceee22f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,171,67,201,224,203,8,146,179,206,228,247,4,140,165,0,76,238,226,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
