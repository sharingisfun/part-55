In this instance, their 1980 performances at the Sun Devil stadium of Arizona State University in Tempe and at the indoor Meadowlands Arena in New Jersey are presented in sequence. Many camera angles, shots of the crowds, and montages that feature repetitive movements or actions on the part of the performers are combined to spice up the 24 songs. Mick Jagger works the crowd with his batteries supercharged, enough to wear out more sedentary viewers -- which would be just about everyone by comparison. Among the featured tunes are &quot;Time Is on our Side,&quot; &quot;Honky Tonk Woman,&quot; &quot;Jumping Jack Flash,&quot; and &quot;T&amp;A.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Mick Jagger,Keith Richards,Charlie Watts,Ron Wood,Bill Wyman\r\nDIRECTOR......: Hal Ashby\r\nGENRE.........: Concert\r\nRATING........: 6.4/10 439 votes\r\nIMDB link.....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084242\r\nRUNTIME.......: 1h 30mn\r\nSIZE..........: 5.10GiB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: x264 (  )\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x1080\r\nBITRATE.......: 5635 Kbps\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO.........: DTS-HD Master Audio Lossless 16/48 5.1\r\nSOURCE........: Untouched Blu Ray\r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 1.
