The software allows you to enhance photos in a simple and natural way, without the steep learning-curve found in many other software programs.\n\nFrom editing RAW photographs or JPEG, TIFF or DNG photos, LightZone is a complete digital image editing application in a single software package.\n\nLightZone&amp;#039;s intelligent editing features help adjust exposures, boost overall color, correct color shifts and white balance errors, selectively sharpen or blur images or parts of images, remove dust spots and reduce the noise often found in high-ISO digital images.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d95bdd824779e09c7f27d89e65ee28076169fb2","amp;dn":"LightZone+3.5%289420%29+for+Linux","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d95bdd824779e09c7f27d89e65ee28076169fb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,149,189,216,36,119,158,9,199,242,125,137,230,94,226,128,118,22,159,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
