No matter who we are, we are here with a problem. We do\nhave problems ? emotional, physical, mental problems. All of us have them. We need to free ourselves.\nWhen I look at Buddhism, what does Buddhism offer to people, or to society? Buddhism really offers\nfreedom. Freedom. It is not that Buddhism has some freedom to give to you, it actually teaches how\nyou can get it yourself. Suffering, pain, joy, and freedom ? everything is within ourselves. It is we our-\nselves who can make it, it?s we who can let ourselves down. Buddhism gives the way for us to gain\nfreedom; freeing ourselves from our negative neuroses. The bottom line is the negative neuroses, be-\ncause these bring pain. The cause of our pain is nothing but our neuroses. We are so used to them that\nwe don?t even realize we have them. We take that way of functioning for granted. We don?t recognize,\nwe don?t acknowledge it. Sometimes we even give great credit to having those neuroses, which are in\nfact the cause of all our problems. Buddha gives us the way we can be free from those neuroses. When\nyou get there, you enjoy freedom. That?s why we chose to call this little bookmark [with the 64 steps]\nOdyssey to Freedom.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ca557d493a6c44d3ac1dd81e0534dc80027c0ea","amp;dn":"Odyssey+to+Freedom.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ca557d493a6c44d3ac1dd81e0534dc80027c0ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,165,87,212,147,166,196,77,58,193,221,129,224,83,77,200,0,39,192,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
