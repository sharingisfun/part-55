Nik is arguably one of Australia&amp;#039;s most popular and well-known DJs, travelling extensively, performing in all states and capital cities as well as appearing in regional centres. His huge fan base can be attributed to delivering long DJ sets (up to 3 hours) working hard behind and on the decks, watching and reading the crowd and putting an energetic performance physically and musically.\nHe releases DJ mix CDs regularly and tours to promote these, which in turn sees every guest appearance drawing capacity crowds wherever he plays around Australia.\n\nWithout a doubt, Nik Fish would have to be the premiere DJ of the Australian dance music scene. His 2SER radio program &quot;Musiquarium&quot; was exceptional during it&amp;#039;s years on air, as were his back room sessions at Voodoo at Sublime in Sydney.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ffc87864e51fec7ca1b03b2c37b21c515a4179f","amp;dn":"Nik+Fish+Musiquarium","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ffc87864e51fec7ca1b03b2c37b21c515a4179f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,252,135,134,78,81,254,199,202,27,3,178,195,123,33,197,21,164,23,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
