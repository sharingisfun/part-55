It was recorded at Sound Art Studios in 1994 and 1995, and released in 1995 on Reel Big Fish&amp;#039;s independent label Piss Off Records.\nAn EP version of the album was released by Mojo Records after Reel Big Fish released Turn the Radio Off in 1996. The full album was re-released by Mojo in 2000, with a slightly altered track list.\n\nMost of the songs on this record could be classified as &quot;lo-fi&quot;; they were recorded when Reel Big Fish was still maturing as a band (some members were still in high school). The majority of the tracks were rerecorded for Turn the Radio Off, Why Do They Rock So Hard, and Monkeys for Nothin&amp;#039; and the Chimps For Free. &quot;Spin The Globe&quot; had been recorded earlier, on their demo In The Good Old Days..., and a few other songs were taken from their 1994 demos Buy This! and Return of the Mullet. The only songs from this album that have not yet appeared on any other Reel Big Fish album are &quot;Boyfriend,&quot; &quot;Fo&amp;#039; Head,&quot; &quot;Jig,&quot; &quot;Go Away&quot; and &quot;Super Hero #5.&quot; The song on Turn The Radio Off entitled &quot;Everything Sucks&quot; was named after this album.\nThe child on the album cover is Matt Wong&amp;#039;s younger sister.\n\nEnjoy! :)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b317e89d7785646cc7f7a85c39dcd5331fcf0da8","amp;dn":"Reel+Big+Fish+-+Everything+Sucks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b317e89d7785646cc7f7a85c39dcd5331fcf0da8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,23,232,157,119,133,100,108,199,247,168,92,57,220,213,51,31,207,13,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
