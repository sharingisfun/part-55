It was billed as &quot;The Marvel mag of mirth and mayhem&quot; and ran for 26 issues, with issue #1 having an August 1988 cover date and issue #26 being a 1993 &quot;Fall Special.&quot; It typically contained a series of short stories with comedic takes on Marvel heroes and villains, such as having Spider-Ham substitute for Spider-Man.\n\nWhat The--?! spotlighted some of the top artists and writers at the time. Many, such as Stan Lee and John Byrne, contributed works that spoof some of their all-time greatest successes. For example, in issue #2 Byrne creates a tale pitting his work on the Fantastic Four franchise against his work with Superman. The issue goes so far as to have the Lex Luthor character to complain about the changes Byrne made to the Superman legend after Crisis.\n\n[url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_The--%3F%21[/url]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffe29507ee71d5f7518288f28070d360512e7c75","amp;dn":"What+The%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffe29507ee71d5f7518288f28070d360512e7c75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,226,149,7,238,113,213,247,81,130,136,242,128,112,211,96,81,46,124,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
