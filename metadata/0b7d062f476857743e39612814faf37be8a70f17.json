These slimy, green creatures have infested the planet and captured many helpless citizens whom the Chex Warrior must save. The game starts at the landing pad of the research facility on Bazoik, after which you are teleported to the storage facility. The other levels include the laboratory, the arboreum, and finally, the underground caverns of Bazoik, where the Flemoids seem to be making a home for themselves.&quot;\n\n-Wikipedia\n\n\n\nThe very first game to be distributed through cereal boxes.
