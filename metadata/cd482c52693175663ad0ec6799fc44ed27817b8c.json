The story continues from the pivotal year of 1968 when revolutionary fervours of various sorts spread throughout the US and Europe. The episode then looks closely at the German terrorist group called the Baader-Meinhof Group and its Italian counterpart, the Red Brigade. From Europe the story moves to Peru and the group called The Shining Path. From Peru, the terrorism has now spread and mingled into the drug war culture of Colombia.\n\nActual footage of the events and interviews with many of the surviving terrorists provide a profound, multi-sided examination of the story of terrorism.\n\nThe four parts [in separate torrents] are\n1 - In the Name of Liberation\n2 - In the Name of Revolution\n3 - In the Name of God\n4 - In the Name of the State\n\nDirected and written by Jon Blair and Daniel Korn.\nreference link: http://thebox.bz/forums.php?action=viewtopic&amp;topicid=9158\n\nshunster","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd482c52693175663ad0ec6799fc44ed27817b8c","amp;dn":"The+Age+of+Terror+2%2F4+-+In+the+Name+of+Revolution++Discovery+%2820","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd482c52693175663ad0ec6799fc44ed27817b8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,72,44,82,105,49,117,102,58,208,236,103,153,252,68,237,39,129,123,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
