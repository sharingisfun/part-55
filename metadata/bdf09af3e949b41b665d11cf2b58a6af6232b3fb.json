Live at the Fillmore East features many blues covers, such as Chuck Berry&amp;#039;s &quot;Sweet Little Sixteen&quot;, and &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot; and also Willie Dixon&amp;#039;s Spoonful, which was also covered by Cream on their album Wheels of Fire. Unlike Ten Years After studio album A Space In Time, Live At The Fillmore East does not have as much of a pop sound, but more of a 50&amp;#039;s blues sound.\n\n    * Leo Lyons - Bass\n    * Alvin Lee - Guitar and Vocals\n    * Chick Churchill - Organ\n    * Ric Lee - Drums\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdf09af3e949b41b665d11cf2b58a6af6232b3fb","amp;dn":"Ten+Years+After+-+Live+at+Fillmore+East+1970","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdf09af3e949b41b665d11cf2b58a6af6232b3fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,240,154,243,233,73,180,27,102,93,17,207,43,88,166,175,98,50,179,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
