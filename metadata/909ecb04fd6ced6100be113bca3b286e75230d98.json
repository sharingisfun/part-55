So you can spend less time sorting and refining photographs, and more time actually shooting them. Its clean, elegant interface literally steps out of the way and lets you quickly view and work with the images you shot today, as well as the thousands of images that you will shoot over the course of your career. Because no two photographers work alike, Adobe Lightroom adapts to your workflow, not the other way around.\n\nLightroom lets you view, zoom in, and compare photographs quickly and easily. Precise, photography-specific adjustments allow you to fine tune your images while maintaining the highest level of image quality from capture through output. And best of all, it runs on most commonly used computers, even notebook computers used on location.\n\nFeatures :\n\nPerform nondestructive editing\nEnjoy robust support for more than 150 camera raw formats, and experiment with confidence. Adjustments you make to images in Lightroom won&amp;#039;t alter the original data, whether you&amp;#039;re working on a JPEG, TIFF, DNG, or camera raw file.\n\nEnjoy an elegant, uncluttered interface\nEase the learning curve and be productive quickly. Task-oriented modules whisk you through typical workflow tasks by putting just the tools you need at your fingertips.\n\nProfessional editing tools\nFine-tune your photographs with precise, easy-to-use tools for globally correcting white balance, exposure, tone curves, lens distortion, and color casts.\n\nPhotographer profiles\nGet inspired by documentaries of well-known photographers in the Lightroom Design Center.\n\nLightroom/Photoshop Icelandic Adventure\nUsing the Lightroom, photographers uploaded, sorted, adjusted, and output their raw images while still working in the field.\n\nProject Photoshop Lightroom tour\nAdobe brought the Lightroom beta to 25 schools across the U.S. See the work that resulted from the tour.\n\nRobust tools to handle large shoots\n\nSpeedily process high-volume shoots by automatically importing images whenever media cards or cameras are connected to your computer. Then automatically rename files, organize folders, and make nondestructive adjustments as images are imported.\nImport/export presets\n\nStreamline the importing and exporting of your files by saving your frequently used settings in stored presets, which you can recall and apply when needed.\nAutomatic conversion to DNG\n\nIf desired, automatically convert your images from proprietary file formats to the publicly available Digital Negative (DNG) format as they are imported, or easily export photographs from your Library in DNG format.\n\nKey benefits\n\nWork with a tool focused on photographers&amp;#039; needs\n\nAdobe Photoshop Lightroom was designed expressly for professional photographers. From its elegant, uncluttered interface to its carefully tailored tools and features, Lightroom puts your photographs first and helps you get your work at the computer done faster. To guide the development of Lightroom, Adobe actively sought the input of experienced photographers during a groundbreaking public beta program. Everything from image viewing and evaluation tools to timesaving editing features was developed with help from the photographers who participated in the program.\n\n\nAccelerate your workflow\n\nLightroom is a nimble tool that moves you efficiently through every step of your workflow, from image capture to client presentation. Use flexible tools and features to manage the processing of large volumes of photographs, and customize a wide range of importing, renaming, and metadata stamping functions to suit your needs. Easily assemble and output high-quality printed contact sheets, online web galleries, and slide shows for client presentation. And keep track of the changes you&amp;#039;ve made to images, including alternate versions, easily and automatically with the History panel.\nUse it your way\n\nLightroom is adaptable and compatible ? with the way you work, with the hardware you use, and with open standards rather than proprietary systems and formats. Use it on MicrosoftÃ‚Â® WindowsÃ‚Â® or the Mac OS. Work with JPEG and TIFF images or more than 140 raw file formats ? which you can convert to the universal DNG format without a loss of image quality. Store your photographs in the Lightroom Library ? even if they&amp;#039;re located on offline media. Switch to Adobe Photoshop software (sold separately) at any time to perform detailed editing, and then return to Lightroom to see the changes reflected in the Library. And take advantage of robust metadata support and advanced keywording capabilities to help you find the photographs you need quickly and easily.\n\nBack to top\nThe top reasons to buy Adobe Photoshop Lightroom\nExtensive workflow support\n\nTransfer and work with large volumes of photographs with ease.
