With rumours of abduction, mixed-in with a clash of cultures, plus the underlying theme of Islam, it is a powerful and personal tale that has, at its heart, the breakdown of a marriage. Despite the story having had huge media coverage the mother has never talked on television. Now she breaks her silence. With unique access to all parties in the dispute we see an insightful account of why it all went wrong and what hope remains for the family in the future.\n\nTime: 22:35 to 23:25 (50 minutes long).\nWhen: Tuesday 13th February on BBC 1 Scotland\n\nDIVX 528x432\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f5f0844d61f32e500db4940055bb1104c741f25","amp;dn":"storyline_BBC.documentary_my.name.is.misbah_molly.campbell.abduc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f5f0844d61f32e500db4940055bb1104c741f25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,95,8,68,214,31,50,229,0,219,73,64,5,91,177,16,76,116,31,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
