It is ideal for anyone who wants to listen to articles while traveling, exercising or just relaxing.\nPLEASE SEED\n\n******* I NEED TO ASK YOU FOR A FAVOR *******\n\nThe oversea community is missing torrents from the show REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER which airs every Friday night on HBO. As I am living oversea I do not have HBO here. The previous uploader for this show unfortunately stopped posting these. There is a huge oversea community relying on these uploads to see these shows.\nThere must be some member of the general community that could do that, no?\nPLEASE, if you have HBO and know how to create good quality AVI files then your contribution would be really, really much appreciated! THANK YOU\n\n*****************************\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7191825126ca292a9762769e35c3fc5a1d36e06a","amp;dn":"The+Economist+April+12th+-+April+18th+2008.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7191825126ca292a9762769e35c3fc5a1d36e06a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,145,130,81,38,202,41,42,151,98,118,158,53,195,252,90,29,54,224,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
