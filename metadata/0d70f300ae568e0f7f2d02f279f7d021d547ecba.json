It was filmed in December 2000 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Only two of the songs are new songs (Higher Place (Track #1 on the album Arrival), and All The Way (Track #2 on the album Arrival)); the others are Journey songs from before Steve Augeri took over as lead vocalist (obviously, since people loved Journey for Perry and not Augeri (and the current lead vocalist, Arnel Pineda)).\n \n\n ___________________________________________________________\n|DVD Back:\t\t\t\t\t\t    |\n|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|\n| Returning to the stage in 1998 with a new lineup featuring|\n| founding members Neal Schon on guitar, Ross Valory on     |\n| bass and long-time member Jonathan Cain on keyboards,     |\n| the band is joined by Steve Augeri on lead vocals and Deen|\n| Castronovo on drums.\t\t\t\t\t    |\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    |\n| The group rocks with classic performances of their\t    |\n| greatest hits and new songs from their 2001 CD Arrival.   |\n| Filmed in December 2000 in Las Vegas, the band roars back |\n| onto the stage.\t\t\t\t\t    |\n|___________________________________________________________|\n\n\n _________________________________________________\n|\t\t---Track Listing---\t\t  |\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t  |\n|\t1.
