The show itself is pretty good, including Sweet Caroline, that is very rare for 1973. Some of the other highlights are &quot;Steamroller blues&quot; (with James Burton guitarworks just being outstanding), What now my love&quot; and a bluesy version of Hound Dog. The bonus song is a longer (edited) version of &quot;Don&amp;#039;t think twice&quot; and last over 14 minutes.\n\nSo this is my last torrent for now, enjoy and help seeding\n\nVisit Peru.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:111b7ffc035a25f775429178b142330791946edc","amp;dn":"ELVIS+PRESLEY+-+Don%5C%27t+think+twice+-+Enero+29+1973+Las+Vegas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"111b7ffc035a25f775429178b142330791946edc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,27,127,252,3,90,37,247,117,66,145,120,177,66,51,7,145,148,110,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
