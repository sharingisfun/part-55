Another lie ? the truth is:\nHILLARY LIE: I helped to create the Children?s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) that provides five million children with health insurance.\n\nTHE FACTS: Hillary had nothing to do with creating CHIP. It was included in the budget deal between her husband and Republican Majority Leader Senator Trent Lott. The money came half from the budget deal and half from the Attorney Generals? tobacco settlement. Hillary had nothing to do with either source of funds.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:564bcb8b1c7e3d322ebd672e0009f3850c84b427","amp;dn":"Hillary+Clinton+Vs.+Barack+Obama%2C+In+The+News.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"564bcb8b1c7e3d322ebd672e0009f3850c84b427","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,75,203,139,28,126,61,50,46,189,103,46,0,9,243,133,12,132,180,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
