Frank Corvin \n\nTommy Lee Jones ...  Hawk Hawkins \n\nDonald Sutherland ...  Jerry O&amp;#039;Neill \n\nJames Garner ...  Tank Sullivan \n\nJames Cromwell ...  Bob Gerson \n\nMarcia Gay Harden ...

Eugene Davis \n\n\nIn 1958, four hot shot test pilots seem certain to be the first men to go into outer space. \n\nHowever, the back-stabbing leader of their organization disbands them to prevent their \n\ninvolvement in the then forming NASA and labels them as non-team players. Flash forward to \n\nthe present, the foursome are now living a docile life. The electrical engineer (Clint \n\nEastwood has a pleasant retired life in a desert home with his wife (Barbara Babcock). The \n\npilot (Tommy Lee Jones), who had a penchant for pushing the test planes to their limits, is \n\nnow a daredevil crop-duster. The navigator (James Garner) is a Baptist minister. The \n\ndesigner (Donald Sutherland) is a womanizing roller coaster designer. Their former boss \n\n(James Cromwell) is now a mission leader in Nasa and still as despicable as in his younger \n\ndays. It is here that the main story begins. It seems that an old Russian &quot;communications&quot; \n\nsatellite is about to crash back into the Earth&amp;#039;s atmosphere and somehow American technology \n\ndesigned by Eastwood&amp;#039;s character has ended up as the guiding system.\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n___________________________________\nTrivia:The night scenes where Tommy Lee Jones and Marcia Gay Harden are alone together was \n\nfilmed in the University of Houston - Downtown campus satellite parking lot; permission from \n\nthe university was needed to film the night scenes. Clint Eastwood met with UHD president \n\nDr. Maximillian Castillo in person in late 1998 before filming began.\n\nClint Eastwood wrote the theme that plays at the beginning of the movie and it was worked \n\ninto the score by Lennie Niehaus.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n______________________________________\n\nVideo info: MPEG2 720x480 NTSC 16:9 letbox  PGC 1.
