This testimony was taken for the creation of &quot;findings of fact&quot; about marijuana to be included in House Bill 149. \nIronically, even though the most powerful, non-anecdotal testimony came out against prohibition, the bill included &quot;findings of fact&quot; that included common myths about marijuana and ignored all but the testimony in favor of prohibition. \nIt is widely thought in Alaska that the bill&amp;#039;s sponsors knew their &quot;findings of fact&quot; would be against marijuana, despite the show of taking testimony. At the urging of former Gov. Frank Murkowski&amp;#039;s administration, the bill was designed to lay the foundation for a legal assault by the state on its own constitutional &quot;right to privacy&quot;, which the courts cited as protecting the citizens right to have small amounts of marijuana in the home. \nThis is very good testimony, and today in 2008, the Alaska Supreme Court will be deciding again, based in part on this bill, just how far the State can infringe on the right to privacy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cbafb31993bdd43c9ce99853cd66877c8666314","amp;dn":"Alaska+HB149+Testimony+on+Marijuana","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cbafb31993bdd43c9ce99853cd66877c8666314","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,186,251,49,153,59,221,67,201,206,153,133,60,214,104,119,200,102,99,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
