Suspicious, Poirot heads for her hometown of Market Basing to find her already dead. A now cold trail of clues leads Poirot through a colorful cast of characters and one of Christie?s typically cozy villages as he attempts to solve a murder that confounds even his superior skills. Reader Hugh Fraser masterfully evokes Christie?s distinctive world.\n\nPlease seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0fb9140d9d133fb640a2d0e5a9bbb96f45c7559","amp;dn":"Dumb+Witness+a+Poirot+audiobook+64kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0fb9140d9d133fb640a2d0e5a9bbb96f45c7559","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,251,145,64,217,209,51,251,100,10,45,14,90,155,187,150,244,92,117,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
