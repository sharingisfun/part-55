Mitropoulos (ÃƒÂ¢??Marvel in three ActsÃƒÂ¢??), with a libretto from the French text of the play ÃƒÂ¢??Soeur BeatriceÃƒÂ¢?? (1900) by Maurice Maeterlinck.  It was written in 1918 and was first staged at the Municipal Theatre of Athens on 11 and 13 May 1920 under the direction of the composer himself.  The role of Sister Beatrice in that first staging was played by Katina Paxinou, a friend of Mitropoulos, who was then attempting a carrier as a lyric singer, and who also personally had undertaken the biggest part of the expenses of the staging.  The orchestra was directed by Armand Marsick, who was the schoolteacher and the mentor of the then young Mitropoulos.  The first night of the staging was attended by composer Camille Saint-Sa?ns, who commented favourably on the work and its young composer.\nSince then, the opera was never staged again (due to the excessive self-criticism attitude of the composerÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦), but ÃƒÂ¢??it was revivedÃƒÂ¢?? recently in an exceptional way at Thessalonica (Hall of Ceremonies AUTH, 1.11.1996) with the New Bulgarian Symphonic Orchestra and the Chorus ÃƒÂ¢??Voices of SofiaÃƒÂ¢??.  The re-establishment of the musical text as well as the general musical direction were done by Byron Fidetzis.  Cast: Martha Arapi (Beatrice), Varvara Tsambali (Abbess), Vangelis Hadjissimos (Prince Bellidor) and select Bulgarian soloists (in the secondary roles).  Martha Arapi was very good in the leading role.  The musical preparation was done by Dimitris Yakas.\nAnd only the fact itself of making the first recording publication of Dimitri MitropoulosÃƒÂ¢?? unique opera is undoubtedly important.  The reasons are obvious.  Known as one of the leading directors of the 20th century, Mitropoulos - the Composer continues remaining still mainly unknown.  Therefore, as Byron Fidetzis also rightly points out in the introductory text of the CD, ÃƒÂ¢??what is important however now is to afford the work an opportunity to be heard and exist as a work of art in the conscience of todayÃƒÂ¢??s listeners; and this basic need is being fulfilled by the present recordingÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â».\n\n\n[b]SYNOPSIS/[b]\nThe story is set in a 13th century French convent. At the beginning of the opera (Scene I) Sister Beatrice is praying to the statue of the Virgin. She confesses that she is about to commit mortal sin, that she is going to leave the convent with Prince Bellidor who told her that he loved her. She is torn between her love for the Virgin and her love for the prince. When the prince arrives he uses 17th century musical language to seduce Beatrice into coming with him. He removes her veil and her mantle which she leaves at the foot of the statue of the Virgin, and they run off together.\nImmediately after they leave, (Scene II) the statue of the Virgin comes alive. She puts on the veil and mantle Sister Beatrice left on the floor and assumes Sister BeatriceÃƒÂ¢??s duty of giving alms to the poor. Allette, a young girl, comes to the door and says shyly that the ÃƒÂ¢??poor brothersÃƒÂ¢?? are not coming because they saw Sister Beatrice riding away with the prince. The Virgin kisses Allette, and soon Allette believes that the Virgin is Sister Beatrice. They hear a chorus of pilgrims approaching. The pilgrims sing a medieval pilgrim song with words that (as pilgrim songs do) praise the Virgin, but they do not realize that they are singing it to the Virgin herself. The Virgin, dressed as Sister Beatrice, forgives all their sins and gives them garments that turn into radiant jewel-covered robes.\nAfter the pilgrims leave the Abbess reproaches Sister Beatrice for forgetting to ring the matin bells, and when she notices the statue of the Virgin is gone she blames Sister Beatrice for not guarding her properly. Furthermore the Abbess notices that Sister BeatriceÃƒÂ¢??s garments have a glow about them. She removes Sister BeatriceÃƒÂ¢??s veil and mantle and condemns Sister Beatrice for ÃƒÂ¢??stealing the imageÃƒÂ¢?? of the Virgin. A chorus of nuns joins her as they command Sister Beatrice to speak, but she does not answer. They call the Priest who tells the nuns to take off their belts and beat Sister Beatrice with the rods of penance. They take her offstage. Immediately there is a chaotic cacophony from which emerges a six voice setting of the ÃƒÂ¢??Ave Maris Stella.ÃƒÂ¢?? The nuns enter holding flowers and the stage is full of flowers. Sister Beatrice turned their belts and rods into flowers. Everyone proclaims that Sister Beatrice is holy.\nTwenty-five years pass and Scene III looks exactly like the end of Scene IÃƒÂ¢??the statue of the Virgin is in place, and Sister BeatriceÃƒÂ¢??s veil and mantle are on the floor. It is winter. Sister Beatrice, now old and sick enters the convent and throws herself at the foot of the statue. She tells the statue of the Virgin what has happened to her, the scandal that her life became out in the world, and that she has come back to the convent to die. She finds the veil and mantle and puts them on. The sisters enter and they think that she has aged overnight. They also notice that the statue of the Virgin has returned to them.\nSister Beatrice is confused. She asks her sisters to pardon her. She tells them that she left the convent with Prince Bellidor 25 years ago, that he left her after three months, that she became a prostitute, that three of her children died and that she killed her fourth child herself so it wouldnÃƒÂ¢??t suffer.\nThe sisters do not believe her because they know Sister Beatrice was with them every day. Sister Beatrice does not understand why the sisters are not angry with her. The opera ends with her words ÃƒÂ¢??I have lived in a world where I did not understand the aims of hate and misery, and now I die in another world where I do not understand the aims of mercy and love.ÃƒÂ¢??\n\n\nTechnical Characteristics\nRipper:  dBpoweramp  v12.4 (Secure Mode)\n\n(MP3:  164Mb)\nEncoder:  LAME v3.97\nSettings:  -V 0 --vbr-new\nEstimated bitrate:  240 kbps (VBR)\nStereo Mode:  Joint Stereo\n\n(FLAC:  496Mb)\nEncoder:  FLAC v1.2.1\nSettings:  -8 -V","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:227dce04516f41e6582da3c42633ff9fdb3aa520","amp;dn":"Dimitri+Mitropoulos+-+Sister+Beatrice+%5Bgreek+classical+opera%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"227dce04516f41e6582da3c42633ff9fdb3aa520","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,125,206,4,81,111,65,230,88,45,163,196,38,51,255,159,219,58,165,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
