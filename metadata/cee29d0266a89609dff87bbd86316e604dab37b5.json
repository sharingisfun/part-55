VA - Virtuosity (Original Sountrack)\n\n\nThe soundtrack to the Denzel Washington-starring thriller Virtuosity has a decidedly dance-influenced slant, but is balanced out with a handful of alternative rock tracks, the best-known of which would be Live&amp;#039;s &quot;White, Discussion.&quot; The reformed Talking Heads sans David Byrne and thusly appearing as The Heads contribute the slinky &quot;No Talking, Just Head&quot; (with Debbie Harry taking the lead on vocals). However, most of the material here is more along the lines of Fatima Mansion&amp;#039;s pulsating dance-rocker &quot;The Loyaliser,&quot; Juno Reactor&amp;#039;s &quot;Samurai,&quot; and techno in the form of Traci Lords&amp;#039; &quot;Fallen Angel.&quot; With all of the songs here having appeared elsewhere and the album as a whole having little cohesion, the only fans that might feel compelled to seek out the Virtuosity soundtrack would be Peter Gabriel devotees as his fine collaboration with The Worldbeaters, &quot;Party Man,&quot; is unavailable elsewhere.
