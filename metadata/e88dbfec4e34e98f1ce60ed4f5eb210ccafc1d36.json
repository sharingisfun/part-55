As well as producing Yazz&amp;#039; smash hit &quot;Stand Up For Your Love Rights&quot; in 1988, they also landed several Top 20 hits under the Beatmasters moniker with a series of guest vocalists: The Cookie Crew (&quot;Rok Da House&quot;), Betty Boo (&quot;Hey DJ / I Can&amp;#039;t Dance (To That Music You&amp;#039;re Playing)&quot;), Merlin MC (&quot;Who&amp;#039;s in the House&quot;) and P.P. Arnold (&quot;Burn It Up&quot;). These hits were all featured on their debut album &quot;Anywayawanna&quot;. After their second album &quot;Life &amp; Soul&quot; (1991), The Beatmasters ditched their own recording career in favour of production work and remixes for artists such as The Shamen, Moby, Erasure, Pet Shop Boys and Marc Almond.\n\n\nMembers: Amanda Glanfield, Paul Carter, Richard Walmsley\n\n\n\n\n01.
