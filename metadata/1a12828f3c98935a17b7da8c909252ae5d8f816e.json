In the early 1940&amp;#039;s, Rommel&amp;#039;s juggernaut Afrika Korps dominated North Africa. But as the tide turned and he came to the painful realization that his Fuhrer, to whom he hd sworn allegiance, was destroying Germany, his ingrained sense of duty pushed him into a conspiracy against Hitler. Co-starring Jessica Tandy as Rommel&amp;#039;s wife and Cedric Hardwicke as another anti-Hitler conspirator, The Desert Fox is an intimate look at one of the most respected military tacticians of modern times. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a12828f3c98935a17b7da8c909252ae5d8f816e","amp;dn":"The+Desert+Fox+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a12828f3c98935a17b7da8c909252ae5d8f816e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,18,130,143,60,152,147,90,23,183,218,140,144,146,82,174,93,143,129,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
