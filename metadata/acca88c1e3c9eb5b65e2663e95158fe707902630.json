Enjoy.\n\t\n\n\n  \t\nCustomer Review #2\n5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing music by David Baerwald from David and David, January 16, 1999\n\nDavid Baerwald has created a killer jazz/blues soundtrack. Something you would put on at a dinner party \nand just chill. He sings one song, Black Mamba Kiss, that is as good as his song &quot;Welcome to the Boomtown&quot; \nfrom his David and David days.\n\n\n\nEditorial Reviews\nJerry McCulley \nDavid Baerwald, formerly of late-&amp;#039;80s one-album wonders David &amp; David, a principal contributor to Sheryl Crow&amp;#039;s \nsmash debut, and author of a pair of darkly brilliant, musically adventurous solo albums (Bedtime Stories, Triage),\napproaches his first major film-scoring gig with every ounce of his iconoclastic verve intact. \nBaerwald and the Palindrome Floating Band (a gathering that includes Mark Isham, Charlie Sexton, and David Torn) \nproduce an underscore for director Anthony Drazan&amp;#039;s adaptation of David Rabe&amp;#039;s play--a cutting portrait of a \ngroup of Hollywood players flailing in a cesspool of narcissism, misogyny, and addiction--that segues slyly \nfrom cool, modern takes on traditional jazz-quartet variations into a landscape of boozy R&amp;B vocals and even \nskewed country flavors. Much to his credit, Baerwald doesn&amp;#039;t let his oft-sardonic muse \n(sample titles: &quot;Oedipal Blues,&quot; &quot;Mambo Phallistico&quot;) mug his smart musical taste; it&amp;#039;s all bookended by a \nMorricone-esque wordless women&amp;#039;s choral &quot;theme&quot; that&amp;#039;s as thematically ironic as it is melodically irresistible.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \t\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acca88c1e3c9eb5b65e2663e95158fe707902630","amp;dn":"%28VERY+ADDICTIVE%29+Hurly+Burly+-+Soundtrack++%2F++David+Baerwald+%26+t","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acca88c1e3c9eb5b65e2663e95158fe707902630","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,202,136,193,227,201,235,91,101,226,102,62,149,21,143,231,7,144,38,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
