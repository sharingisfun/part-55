WinPatrol PLUS provides easy to understand descriptions of over 18,000 programs.\n\nAs a robust SECURITY MONITOR, WinPatrol will alert you to hijackings, malware attacks and critical changes made to your computer without your permission. WinPatrol PLUS includes our unique, patent pending R.I.D. technology.\n\nWinPatrol uses a heuristic behavioral approach to detecting attacks and violations of your computing environment. Traditional security programs scan your hard drive searching for previously identified threats. WinPatrol takes snapshot of your critical system resources and alerts you to any changes that may occur without your knowledge. You&amp;#039;ll be removing dangerous new programs while others prepare to update their definition/signature data files.\n\nWhen a vulnerability is found Scotty will let you disable or set the ÃƒÂ¢??kill-bitÃƒÂ¢?? on the appropriate control until a new one is made available.\n\nWinPatrol will also monitor your system and let you know when new ActiveX components try to make their home on your system. If itÃƒÂ¢??s not something you wanted WinPatrol will kill the new component before it can do any damage.\n\nWinpatrol 2008 is vista compatible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad28591ccc0cef7c476a651e351c804adeab88b1","amp;dn":"WinPatrol+2008+PLUS+v15.0.2008.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad28591ccc0cef7c476a651e351c804adeab88b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,40,89,28,204,12,239,124,71,106,101,30,53,28,128,74,222,171,136,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
