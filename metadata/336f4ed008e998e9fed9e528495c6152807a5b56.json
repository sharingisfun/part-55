The film features Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sharon Stone, based on the Phillip K Dick story &quot;We Can Remember It For You Wholesale&quot;. The film was directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Ronald Shusett, Dan O?Bannon, Jon Povill, and Gary Goldman. It won a Academy Special Achievement Award for its visual effects. \n\nAt the time of its production, Total Recall had the largest authorized budget for a film produced by a Hollywood studio.[1] The film?s success confirmed Schwarzenegger as a major box office draw and relaunched Sharon Stone?s career scoring her a role in the hugely successful Basic Instinct, in 1992, also directed by Verhoeven.

I found one dvdshrink (shit) version and some other one. That one had no information about compression or bitrates or nothing.\nI opened movie with DvdRemake pro and removed all shit and it fit to a DVD5 without compressing. There would have been space those aninimations between every menu link, but they are driving me crazy.
