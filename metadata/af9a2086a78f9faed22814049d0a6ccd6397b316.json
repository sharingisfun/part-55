It was directed by Yoshishige Yoshida, who wrote it in cooperation with Masahiro Yamada.\n\nThe film is a biography of anarchist Sakae Ãƒâ€¦?sugi, assassinated by the Japanese military in 1923. The story tells of his relationship with three women: Hori Yasuko, his wife; Noe ItÃƒâ€¦?, his third lover, who was to die with him; and his jealous, second lover, Masaoka Itsuko, a militant feminist who attempts to kill him in a tea house in 1916. Parallel to the telling of Ãƒâ€¦?sugiÃƒÂ¢??s life, two students do research on the political theories and ideas of free love that he upheld. Some of the characters from the past and from the present meet and engage the themes of the movie.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af9a2086a78f9faed22814049d0a6ccd6397b316","amp;dn":"Eros.Plus.Massacre.1970.EXTENDED.DVDRip.XviD-HanStyle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af9a2086a78f9faed22814049d0a6ccd6397b316","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,154,32,134,167,143,159,174,210,40,20,4,157,10,108,205,99,151,179,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
