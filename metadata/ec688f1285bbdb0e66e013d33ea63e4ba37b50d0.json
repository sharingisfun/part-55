Based on a story by Edogawa Rampo, it promises to be fantastic and phantasmagoric as well.\n\nMy rip.\n\nAn IMdB user comment:\n\nA discovery like this reminds me how much more there is to Japanese cinema besides Kurosawa, Ozu, and Mizoguchi. Well, my two favorite Japanese filmmakers are Sezuki Seijun and Shinya Tsukamoto, maverick filmmakers in their own country. Yasuza Masumura may be thrown on that list pretty quickly here, although this production doubtlessly had more money than, say, Branded to Kill. I won&amp;#039;t go into too much detail with Blind Beast. Suffice it to say that it&amp;#039;s one of the best films I&amp;#039;ve ever seen. It&amp;#039;s easy to compare it to some vaguely arty trash like In the Realm of the Senses (and I say that in the best way). That film was discovered by the French. I wish they would have found this and canonized it instead. It&amp;#039;s far more artistically accomplished, and much, much more emotionally and physically draining. 10/10.  - zetes\n\n--- File Information ---               \nFile Size (in bytes):                           655,108,096                     \n                                                                                \n--- Container Information ---                                                   \nBase Type (e.g &quot;AVI&quot;):                          AVI(.AVI)                 \nSubtype (e.g &quot;OpenDML&quot;):                        OpenDML (AVI v2.0),                   \nInterleave (in ms):                             42          \nPreload (in ms):                                504       \nAudio alignment(&quot;split across interleaves&quot;):    Aligned         \nTotal System Bitrate (kbps):                    0            \nBytes Missing (if any):                         0            \nNumber of Audio Streams:                        1       \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Type(e.g. &quot;DIV3&quot;):                  xvid              \nVideo Codec Name(e.g. &quot;DivX 3, Low-Motion&quot;):    XviD              \nVideo Codec Status(e.g. &quot;Codec Is Installed&quot;):  Codec(s) are Installed            \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):                            01:24:06                \nFrame Count:                                    120984             \nFrame Width (pixels):                           720                  \nFrame Height (pixels):                          320                  \nFrame Aspect Ratio (e.g &quot;1.3333&quot;):                        \nFrame Aspect Ratio (e.g. &quot;4:3&quot;):                             \nPixel Aspect Ratio (&quot;SAR&quot;):                                          \nDisplay Aspect Ratio (&quot;DAR&quot;):                   2.250                     \nFrames Per Second:                           23.96                 \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):                           927                 \nMPEG-4 (&quot;MPEG-4&quot; or &quot;&quot;):                        MPEG-4                   \nB-VOP (&quot;B-VOP&quot; or &quot;&quot;):                          B-VOP        \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---            \nAudio Codec (e.g. &quot;AC3&quot;):                       0x0055(MP3, ISO) MPEG-1 Layer 3          \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):                         48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):                            103                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):            VBR            \nAudio Channel Count (e.g. &quot;2&quot; for stereo):      2           \n\n\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
