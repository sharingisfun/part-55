While there are no recurring characters or official ties, the director explicitly states on DVD commentaries and in interviews that he considers them a collective body of work, referring to them as his Apocalypse Trilogy\n\nAll three films feature a higher supernatural force (In The Thing it is an alien, in Prince of Darkness it is Satan and in In the Mouth of Madness it is an H.P. Lovecraft influenced set of evil demi-gods) which use human beings against each other. The three endings to the Apocalypse Trilogy also contain many of the same elements, all of which imply that the end of the world may be imminent\n\nEnjoy!
