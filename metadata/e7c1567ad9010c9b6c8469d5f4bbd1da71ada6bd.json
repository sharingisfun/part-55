These life-threatening incidents range through the history of powered flight and all over the globe from Arctic waste to desert sand and from English hillside to coral reef.\r\n\r\n Within the narrative are moments of humor, despair and utter joy. The author has gleaned his information from a myriad of sources and many personal accounts. For those who love to read of the human spirit and its determination to survive against all odds - this book makes splendid reading.\r\n\r\n**PLEASE SEED**","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7c1567ad9010c9b6c8469d5f4bbd1da71ada6bd","amp;dn":"Aircraft+Down%3A+Landings%2C+Crash+Landings+and+Rescues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7c1567ad9010c9b6c8469d5f4bbd1da71ada6bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,193,86,122,217,1,12,155,108,132,105,213,244,187,209,218,113,173,166,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
