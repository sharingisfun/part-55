The band were formed by Joe Strummer (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Mick Jones (lead guitar, backing vocals) and Paul Simonon (bass guitar, backing vocals). They originally had a revolving drumming position; Terry Chimes featured on the band&amp;#039;s eponymous first album, The Clash, released in April 1977. Needing a stable drummer, they were joined later that year by Jones&amp;#039;s friend Nicky &quot;Topper&quot; Headon (drums, percussion). This is the lineup from the band&amp;#039;s peak, responsible for most of its recorded output, and the lineup named by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The group disbanded in early 1986, owing to lack of creative control and the loss of Headon in 1982 and Jones in 1983 due to internal friction. Strummer later apologised for their firing, admitting that it was a huge loss to the band.\n\n\n\n\n\n.ooOO ROSA MANNEN 2008 OOoo.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RosaMannen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RosaMannen&lt;/a&gt;\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:023605ed7dc2a7413320aa31c0463c26b17c641d","amp;dn":"The+Clash+-+Capitol+Radio+%28Live+Elizabethan+Suite+1977%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"023605ed7dc2a7413320aa31c0463c26b17c641d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,54,5,237,125,194,167,65,51,32,170,49,192,70,60,38,177,124,100,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
