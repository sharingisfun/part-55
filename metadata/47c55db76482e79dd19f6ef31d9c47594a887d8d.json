Of these, gravity may be the most obvious, but it is also the most mysterious. Newton managed to predict the force of gravity but couldnâ€™t explain how it worked at a distance. Einstein picked up on the simple premise that gravity and acceleration are interchangeable to devise his mind-bending general relativity, showing how matter warps space and time. Not only did this explain how gravity worked â€“ and how apparently simple gravitation has four separate components â€“ but it predicted everything from black holes to gravityâ€™s effect on time. Whether itâ€™s the reality of anti-gravity or the unexpected discovery that a ball and a laser beam drop at the same rate, gravity is the force that fascinates","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47c55db76482e79dd19f6ef31d9c47594a887d8d","amp;dn":"Gravity+How+the+Weakest+Force+in+the+Universe+Shaped+Our+Lives+b","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47c55db76482e79dd19f6ef31d9c47594a887d8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,197,93,183,100,130,231,157,209,159,110,243,29,156,71,89,74,136,125,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
