For what was a BRILLIANT Content Management System, it seems to me so complex when it \n\ncame to designing the Templates. Arcane instructions left me bewildered. I really didn&amp;#039;t know which way to turn.\n\nI began by &amp;#039;buying in&amp;#039; ready made templates and trying to convert them. But there was something missing. Trying to embed my own graphics was a \n\nnightmare. What I needed was a simple way to take my own graphic headers etc and create a Joomla Template Package ready to rock&amp;#039;n roll.\n\nSure there were plenty of Dreamweaver Add-On&amp;#039;s but I need something that would run directly from Windows - a kind of simple Q+A - Fill in the \n\nBlanks and Go.\n\nAnd so ..... I got it made and I&amp;#039;m passing on the benefits to you.\n\nTemplate Creation without even a sniff of Dreamweaver or any other HTML Editor.\n\n    *  Stand-Alone Windows Program\n\n    * Creates Complete Zip Template package ready to upload\n\n    * Includes creation of valid XML file - You need to add NOTHING.\n\n\nWhat Does It Do?\n\nQuite Simply it takes your graphic images and creates a complete template zip file ready to load into Joomla. It does what it says quickly and cleanly.\n\nTechnically - It creates a 100% width &amp;#039;autostretch&amp;#039; 3 column layout. The layout is 3 seperate 100% tables &amp;#039;stacked&amp;#039; vertically-the top table is for the \n\nheader area, the middle table is for the Joomla left, center and right columns, and the bottom table is for the footer area. Additionally, the middle \n\ntable will contain a 3 column 100% nested table. In addition we create the valid XML file and CSS descriptors all ready to run.\n\nWhat comes with the package?\n\nYou receive the following:\n\n    * Complete Windows Application\n    * &quot;How to&quot; Movie\n    * Documentation Package\n\nWhat Do You Need To Provide?\n\n    * Windows XP minimum\n    * Header, Background and Thumbnail Graphics\n    * That&amp;#039;s it!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06fca109e49648304371c5449da8141663eba04e","amp;dn":"JoomlaTemplatemaker+-+Retail","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06fca109e49648304371c5449da8141663eba04e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,252,161,9,228,150,72,48,67,113,197,68,157,168,20,22,99,235,160,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
