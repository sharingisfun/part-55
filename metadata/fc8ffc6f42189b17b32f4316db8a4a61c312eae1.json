The band was formed in 1990, gaining limited popularity in Europe&amp;#039;s underground nightclub scene during the mid-1990s before expanding into other markets in the goth and industrial subcultures. The band&amp;#039;s discography includes 12 albums.\n\nThe majority of the band&amp;#039;s work is categorized among the genres of industrial, Gothic, electro-industrial, and EBM. The band&amp;#039;s tone ranges between angry, upbeat, sad, and psychedelic. The band&amp;#039;s lyrical content offers a varied focus, including such topics as depression, love, misanthropy, drugs, hate, and religion. Many of the topics addressed in the group&amp;#039;s songs were written by Erickson as a means of expressive release during personally challenging times.\n\nMuch of Velvet Acid Christ&amp;#039;s musical composition has been produced with synthesizers and computer software (see Computer music). Other instruments used by the band include sequencers such as drum machines and electric guitars with effects pedals.[1] Sampling, which is the use of sound clips as part of a new recording, is another technique commonly employed by the band.\n\n[url=http://www.velvetacidchrist.com/]Official Website[/url]\n[url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet_Acid_Christ]Wikipedia Article[/url]\n\nSeed !\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc8ffc6f42189b17b32f4316db8a4a61c312eae1","amp;dn":"Velvet+Acid+Christ+-+Lust+for+Blood","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc8ffc6f42189b17b32f4316db8a4a61c312eae1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,143,252,111,66,24,155,23,179,47,67,22,219,138,74,97,195,18,234,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
