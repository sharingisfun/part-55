I decided to distil the entire season into a story that I could watch and enjoy, without having to cringe at some pretty mediocre television.\n\nThe film is three hours and twenty minutes long. (Which includes a specially made, eight minute long recap of the season one finale.) \n\nSome of the episodes are used heavily, others not so much. (For example, I only used one scene from &quot;Gill Girl&quot; and from &quot;Dawg Dog Afternoon&quot;, I literally only used a single shot.) \n\nI sincerely hope you all enjoy. For best viewing, try to forget everything you know about season 2, and don&amp;#039;t let it influence what you expect of this edit. &quot; \n\n~ Uncanny Antman\n\n\n\nTeasers 3 &amp; 4:\n\n\nDuration: 03:19:14\n\n672x288px\n\n\nOriginal thread: http://www.darkangel-network.com/viewtopic.php?t=588","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fd889eef93377650401430e16dd47cc93d83303","amp;dn":"Dark+Angel+-+Children+of+the+Revolution+%28A+Fan+Edit+by+Uncanny+A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fd889eef93377650401430e16dd47cc93d83303","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,216,137,238,249,51,119,101,4,1,67,14,22,221,71,204,147,216,51,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
