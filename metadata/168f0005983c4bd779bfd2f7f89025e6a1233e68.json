is Eminem&amp;#039;s first full-length and professionally packaged album.\n After years of cutting demo tracks with his mentors,\n the Bass Brothers, at their Ferndale, MI. studio (dubbed &quot;The Bassment&quot;),\n Eminem was ready to release his debut album.\n The album was written and recorded in 1995.\n At the time the album was first conceived, Eminem had been using the stage name M&amp;M. \n However, he changed his stage name after the release of his first official single,\n Fuckin&amp;#039; Backstabber in early 1995. Infinite marks the debut of the name &quot;Eminem.&quot;\n The album was only released on cassette and vinyl. \nOnly 1,000 cassettes and 100 vinyls were made. Eminem himself,\n and old friends from around the time Infinite was recorded,\n have claimed the laid-back and humble nature of the album is due\n to Eminem purposely making &quot;radio-friendly&quot; songs in hopes of getting on the air\n of Detroit&amp;#039;s leading Hip Hop radio station,\n WJLB-98. Bootlegged compact-disc copies are commonly found on sites such as eBay.\n The song &quot;Backstabber&quot; is a re-cut version of a song called &quot;Fuckin&amp;#039; Backstabber&quot;, \nwhich is featured on a demo tape by Soul Intent.\n\nThe album received mixed critical reviews and was met with derision \nfrom within the local hip-hop community,\n earning Eminem unfavorable accusations of copying other rappers&amp;#039; styles, \nparticularly Nas and AZ. Eminem recalls:\n&quot;Obviously, I was young and influenced by other artists, \nand I got a lot of feedback saying that I sounded like Nas and AZ. \nInfinite was me trying to figure out how I wanted my rap style to be,\n how I wanted to sound on the mic and present myself. It was a growing stage.\n I felt like Infinite was like a demo that just got pressed up.?\n\nWhile it contains some swearing, Infinite is relatively inoffensive compared to the subsequent\n albums that would make Eminem famous.\n\nIn 2003 this album was released, although it seemed legitimate it was most likely pirated,\n containing many clicks, pops, and other defects in the sound quality. The &quot;European Re-Issue&quot;\n contains a bonus disc with freestyles and unreleased tracks, no names for these tracks are given on the case.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:168f0005983c4bd779bfd2f7f89025e6a1233e68","amp;dn":"Eminem+-+Infinite+-1996+-+320kbit+-+iCe-TorrentZ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"168f0005983c4bd779bfd2f7f89025e6a1233e68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,143,0,5,152,60,75,215,121,191,210,247,248,144,37,230,161,35,62,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
