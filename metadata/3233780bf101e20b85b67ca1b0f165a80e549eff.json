They have been bombing for Operation Point, in the lead up to the invasion of Normandy. A 10 day leave is authorized then cancelled and instead they are assigned to fly the Overleaf missions, dropping leaflets all over the French coast. Everyone is exhausted from Gallagher on down, moral is low, and casualties are high. There are only a handfull of men left to fly so Gallager disobeys orders and pilots the Picadilly Lily which gets shot down on the day of the Normandy invasion.\n\nStars: Paul Burke, Frank Overton, Chris Robinson\nGuest star: William Windom (Lieutenant Colonel Christy), Linden Chiles (Captain Bluitt), Tim McIntire (Lieutenant Wallach), Ivor Barry (Air Marshal Kingsford), Byron Morrow (Brigadier General Adcock)\nWriter: John T.
