Jackie Ross&amp;#039; soulful sweetness on her cover of Evie Sands &amp;#039;Take Me For A Little While&quot;, and Etta James&amp;#039;s frighteningly deep vocal on the wonderful &quot;Mellow Fellow&quot;, and &quot;7Day Fool&quot;. \nHowever there are two reasons why this album needs to exist: Terry Callier&amp;#039;s first cadet single &quot;Look At Me Now&quot;, an obscure piece of soul magic, lost by Terry, forgotten by most until it was unearthed sometime in the mid eighties. A vital introduction to to one of the greatest voices in soul music, from who so little is at present available.  What a voice!\nThe final paragraph must be saved for the diva of this show; Sugar Pie DeSanto a former member of fames Brown&amp;#039;s revue who recorded some of the best female R&amp;#039;n&amp;#039;B records ever. Included here are two duets with Etta fames, the major R&amp;#039;n &amp;#039;B hit &quot;I Don t Wanna Fuss&quot; and the obscure but brilliant &quot;Go Go Power&quot;.
