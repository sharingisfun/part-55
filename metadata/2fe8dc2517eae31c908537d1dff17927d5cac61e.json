They found &amp;#039;treasure&amp;#039; buried just beneath the surface ? a collection of Viking material next to a body. Although they had been detecting on the site for a number of years, during which time they had made large numbers of finds, nothing they had uncovered previously compared with this. They decided to share their discovery with archaeologists.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fe8dc2517eae31c908537d1dff17927d5cac61e","amp;dn":"Time+Team+s15+special34+-+Codename%3A+Ainsbrook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fe8dc2517eae31c908537d1dff17927d5cac61e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,232,220,37,23,234,227,28,144,133,55,209,223,241,121,39,213,202,198,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
