Written by Shaquille\n\nIn Greenbrier Back Country, West Virginia, the retired military Dale Murphy is hosting a tough survivor show where the winner takes US$ 100,000.00.

Soon the contestants find that they are really fighting to survive against a strong, sadistic and violent cannibalistic family with the appearance of monsters.
