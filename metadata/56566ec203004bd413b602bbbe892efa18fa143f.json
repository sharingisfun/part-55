W. Griffith and starring Lillian Gish, Richard Barthelmess and Donald Crisp. The film paints an intimate portrait of Cheng Huan (Barthelmess), a kind hearted Chinese man, and his love for a poor abused girl named Lucy Burrows (Gish).\n\nContrasting with Intolerance?s grand story, set and length, Griffith charmed audiences by the delicacy with which Broken Blossom?s handled such a complex subject.\n\nIn 1996, Broken Blossoms was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.\n\nIMDB: 7.7/10\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0009968/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0009968/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56566ec203004bd413b602bbbe892efa18fa143f","amp;dn":"Broken+Blossoms+%281919%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56566ec203004bd413b602bbbe892efa18fa143f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,86,110,194,3,0,75,212,19,182,2,187,190,137,46,250,24,250,20,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
