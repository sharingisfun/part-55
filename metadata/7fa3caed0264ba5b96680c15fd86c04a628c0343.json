They were actually pretty good when i saw them live at some small local festival so I grabbed this E.P, It&amp;#039;s quite good and well produced. I don&amp;#039;t know really how to describe their sound other than the rather lazy &quot;Rock&quot; [maybe radio friendly rock?] but basically if you like bands like &quot;Hundred Reasons&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, and any other of that type of british rock band you&amp;#039;ll probably enjoy this. I cannot find anything more about the band as their website is no longer active so i assume that sadly they never made it any further or are recording under a different name. Anyway it&amp;#039;s only a small file so if you like rock music give it a try, what have you got to lose?\n\nEnjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fa3caed0264ba5b96680c15fd86c04a628c0343","amp;dn":"Tube+-+Rock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fa3caed0264ba5b96680c15fd86c04a628c0343","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,163,202,237,2,100,186,91,150,104,12,21,253,134,192,74,98,140,3,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
