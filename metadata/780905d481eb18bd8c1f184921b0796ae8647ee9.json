Wipeout 2097 [Direct Play]\n\nWipeout is the title of a series of futuristic anti-gravity racing games, \noriginally produced by Psygnosis for the PlayStation video game console. \nWipeout XL is the second game in the Wipeout series to be released. It moved \nthe Wipeout brand forward, introducing new tracks, new craft, and new weapons \nsuch as the Quake Disruptor (which sent a ripple down the track) that became \ninstant fan favorites. Just as in the original game, players must race \nacross crazy tracks while driving hovercraft from the future. On top of the \nracing action, players need to collect weapons in order to take down their \ncloset competitors. To cater for the increase in Wipeout players, an easier \nlearning curve was introduced whilst keeping the difficulty at top end for \nthe experienced gamers.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Race against up to 12 ships on 6 tracks (Plus two hidden ones!) \n- 11 hi-tech weapons to pick up and unleash onto your rivals\n- Two additional racing classes\n\nSupported OS: Windows 95/98/ME/2K/XP/Vista\n\nGenre: Sports/Arcade/Racing\n\nDeveloper: Psygnosis Limited \n\nRelease Date: May 1997\n\nRipped: Intro Movies and CD Audio\n\nExtras: I&amp;#039;ve added the Soundtrack from the PlayStation and the PC version \n(Music Directory) so you can play it with the original music.
