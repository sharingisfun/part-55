Jones\t... \tHunter Morris\n\nBrian Cox\t... \tJim Morris Sr.\n\nRick Gonzalez\t... \tRudy Bonilla\n\nWhen a shoulder injury ended his minor league pitching career twelve \n\nyears ago, Jim Morris resorted to the next best thing: coaching. But \n\nJim&amp;#039;s team, knowing their coach is a great ball player, makes a deal \n\nwith him: if they win the district championship, they want Jim to try \n\nout for a major-league organization. Going from worst to first, the team \n\nmakes it to state, and Jim is forced to live up to his end of the deal. \n\nWhile there prove to be a lot of pitches to be thrown before he makes it \n\noff the mound, big-league dreams are revived, and there&amp;#039;s no telling \n\nwhere he could go.\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n___________________________________\nTrivia:The scene where Jimmy walks out to the mound for the first time \n\nat The Ballpark in Arlington was filmed during the seventh inning \n\nstretch of a real Rangers game. All of the pitching shots were done \n\nafter the game.\n\nProducers contacted Royce Clayton, the first batter Morris faced in the \n\nMajor Leagues, and got his permission to use his name, etc for the film. \n\nIt actually took Morris four pitches to strike him out. Clayton managed \n\nto hit one foul. But it was too difficult to film a ball going foul, so \n\nthey left it out.\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n______________________________________\n\nVideo info: MPEG2 720x480 NTSC 4:3   PGC 1.
