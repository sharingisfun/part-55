From the initial songs released\nlike &quot;Popular&quot;, people are already chomping at the bit to hear this album. Find\nout for yourself why Outburn Magazine said &quot;Trustkill has definitely struck\ngold, a diamond in the rough of an oversaturated genre.&quot; Produced by Chris\nBadami at Portrait Studios, responsible for albums from The Starting Line and\nThe Early November, &quot;Gave Me The Clap&quot; is 11 songs of pure pop-punk and will\nhave you singing along Instantly!\n\nTravis Weber (singer) said on the new material, &quot;We think the new songs rock...\nhopefully you, our fans will think they do too. This next record will have\nsomething for everyone. We have songs that make you dance, songs that make you\nwant to party, songs that will make you cry, and songs that will make you just\nwant to break something in your room, ha ha.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34d6de3081d7d89d7645ffed9ce63dbe06955a0d","amp;dn":"Crash_Romeo-Gave_Me_The_Clap-2008-RTB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34d6de3081d7d89d7645ffed9ce63dbe06955a0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,214,222,48,129,215,216,157,118,69,255,237,156,230,61,190,6,149,90,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
