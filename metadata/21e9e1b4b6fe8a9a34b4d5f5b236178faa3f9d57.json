This version is not the same as the other one floating out there on Bittorrent. The other one&amp;#039;s audio is very out of sync, and currently has no seeders (stuck at 99%). \n\nThis file is not perfect DVD quality, but it came from a relatively good VHS copy, so it&amp;#039;s a slight improvement on what&amp;#039;s out there. \n\nThis movie is in English, and has no subtitles or DVD extras, it is only the movie. \n\nRuns approx. 117 mins. \n\nThis is the IMDB link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079103/ \n\nAnd here is a link to a page about the attempt to get this released on dVD (includes a petition, please sign): Visit http://members.tripod.com/~evilbaby/Elvis.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21e9e1b4b6fe8a9a34b4d5f5b236178faa3f9d57","amp;dn":"Elvis+Kurt+Russell+1979","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21e9e1b4b6fe8a9a34b4d5f5b236178faa3f9d57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,233,225,180,182,254,138,154,52,180,213,245,178,54,23,143,170,63,157,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
