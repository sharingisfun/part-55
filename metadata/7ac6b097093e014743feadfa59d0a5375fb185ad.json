Whether this is an accurate snapshot of her live act is open to question; the stage business in between numbers seems rather formal and one doesn&amp;#039;t really feel the excitement of a live performance. Yet O&amp;#039;Day is clearly in a creative mood, whether allowing her vulnerability to show in the torchy ballads or reveling in the boppish uptempo workouts. Her vocal on &quot;Tea For Two&quot; is a virtuoso deconstruction, full of satiric quotes and rhythmic shifts at a warp-speed tempo. Fleet-fingered Joe Masters decorates the fills with standard bop runs on the slightly-out-of-tune house piano. \n\nTrack Listing:\n1.But Not For Me (George Gershwin, Ira Gershwin)\n2.I Have A Reason For Living\n3.Varsity Drag (Lew Brown, Buddy DeSylva, Ray Henderson)\n4.It Never Entered My Mind (Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart)\n5.Tea For Two (Vincent Youmans, Irving Caesar)\n6.Every Time I&amp;#039;m With You\n7.Have You Met Miss Jones?
