ChloÃƒÂ« \n\n&gt; Plot:\n&gt;\n&gt; Bruges, the most well-preserved medieval city\n&gt; in the whole of Belgium, is a welcoming destination\n&gt; for travellers from all over the world. But for hit\n&gt; men Ray and Ken, it could be their final destination; \n&gt; a difficult job has resulted in the pair being ordered\n&gt; right before Christmas by their London boss Harry to go \n&gt; and cool their heels in the storybook Flemish city for \n&gt; a couple of weeks. Very much out of place amidst the \n&gt; gothic architecture, canals, and cobbled streets, the \n&gt; two hit men fill their days living the lives of tourists.\n&gt; Ray, still haunted by the bloodshed in London, hates the \n&gt; place, while Ken, even as he keeps a fatherly eye on Ray&amp;#039;s \n&gt; often profanely funny exploits, finds his mind and soul \n&gt; being expanded by the beauty and serenity of the city. But\n&gt; the longer they stay waiting for Harry&amp;#039;s call, the more \n&gt; surreal their experience becomes, as they find themselves \n&gt; in weird encounters with locals, tourists, violent medieval art,\n&gt; a dwarf American actor shooting a European art film, Dutch \n&gt; prostitutes, and a potential romance for Ray in the form of \n&gt; ChloÃƒÂ«, who may have some dark secrets of her own. And when\n&gt; the call from Harry does finally come, Ken and Ray&amp;#039;s vacation\n&gt; becomes a life-and-death struggle of darkly comic proportions\n&gt; and surprisingly emotional consequences\n&gt;\n&gt; BE AWARE OF BOGUS SITES AND LAMERS\n&gt;\n&gt; DOWNLOAD YOUR DUQA FILES FROM DUQA ACCOUNTS\n&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/DUQA-TEAM/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/DUQA-TEAM/&lt;/a&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ENJOY!\n&gt;\n&gt; CLIP\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780536/trailers-screenplay-vi2626748697&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780536/trailers-screenplay-vi2626748697&lt;/a&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Official sites\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.filminfocus.com/focus-movies/in-bruges/movie-splash.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.filminfocus.com/focus-movies/in-bruges/movie-splash.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b432b09f1db10f0a6ea00224802b260da1f5709c","amp;dn":"In+Bruges+.%5B2008%5D.DVDRIP.XVID%5BEng%5D-DUQA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b432b09f1db10f0a6ea00224802b260da1f5709c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,50,176,159,29,177,15,10,110,160,2,36,128,43,38,13,161,245,112,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
