This is where KSync comes in.  You have to buy this program from a company called Reudo for close to $30 and all it really is is just iSync plugins.  That&amp;#039;s a bit steep in my opinion (like so many other seemingly simple Mac apps) so I&amp;#039;m uploading it here to help others.\n\nJust open the DMG and click on the mpkg.  It&amp;#039;s fairly simple.  You will need to use the USB cable for your phone to sync.  I tried bluetooth and it doesn&amp;#039;t work.\n\nI&amp;#039;ve tested this on my Softbank 911T, but this program should work with most, if not all, Japanese cell phones.\n\nIf you found this useful, please seed to help others out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4321738820755459641048159eaad1a8669826f3","amp;dn":"Reudo+KSync+for+Mac+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4321738820755459641048159eaad1a8669826f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,33,115,136,32,117,84,89,100,16,72,21,158,170,209,168,102,152,38,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
