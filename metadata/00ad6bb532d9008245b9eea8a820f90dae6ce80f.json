Following the same flight path in another Concorde, with the TARDIS stowed in the hold, he discovers that it has been transported back millions of years into the past through a time corridor. \n\nOn prehistoric Earth he and his friends encounter a genie-like figure named Kalid and his protoplasmic servants, the Plasmatons. Kalid turns out to be just the latest guise adopted by the Master, who is engaged in a complex scheme to try to gain control of a powerful alien gestalt called the Xeraphin and use it as a dynamorphic generator in his TARDIS.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00ad6bb532d9008245b9eea8a820f90dae6ce80f","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+-+123+-+Time-Flight+-+DVD+%28PAL%29+BBCDVD2327A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00ad6bb532d9008245b9eea8a820f90dae6ce80f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,173,107,181,50,217,0,130,69,185,238,168,168,32,249,13,174,108,232,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
