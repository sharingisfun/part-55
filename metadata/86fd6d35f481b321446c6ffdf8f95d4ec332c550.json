Doogal was a redub of the 2005 UK film The Magic Roundabout starring Robbie Williams, Tom Baker, and Bill Nighy. If you&amp;#039;re looking for the soundtrack to TMR this is it, as they did not change any of the music, including the song sung by characters Dylan and Ermintrude. Tracks are mp3s and I&amp;#039;ve included the Doogal cover art. But if you&amp;#039;re a TMR snob like me you&amp;#039;ll change all the spellings of &quot;Doogal&quot; to &quot;Dougal&quot; and use a Magic Roundabout image, lol. ;) This album of course features the cover of &quot;The Magic Roundabout&quot; by Kylie Minogue (who voiced Florence in both versions).\n\nIf you ever need this reseeded give me a holler at sparky(at)theneitherworld.com, and visit my Magic Roundabout website at http://www.theneitherworld.com/tmr/ :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86fd6d35f481b321446c6ffdf8f95d4ec332c550","amp;dn":"Doogal+-+Soundtrack+%28The+Magic+Roundabout%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86fd6d35f481b321446c6ffdf8f95d4ec332c550","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,253,109,53,244,129,179,33,68,108,111,253,248,249,93,78,195,50,197,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
