Clark Gable and Spencer \nTracy are oil wildcatters who meet during a Texas strike, take an instant \ndislike to each other, go into business together, tussle over a woman, break up, \nreunite, etc., etc. The film spans years, and various parts of the continent, \nas each man gets rich and goes bust with regularity. Claudette Colbert, \nre-teaming with It Happened One Night co-star Gable, is the woman who comes \nbetween them, and Hedy Lamarr presents a more exotic temptation later on. \nAnother star here is the dialogue by veteran screenwriter John Lee Mahin, which-\ndespite the wild, credulity-bending twists in the story--is chockfull of salty, \nslangy talk. The early scenes in the Texas town are crammed with believable oil \njargon and great period touches (such as an entrepreneur who charges money to \nwalk on planks across a muddy street). Director Jack Conway (Saratoga) gets the \nroughneck appeal of the material, and a sequence involving an oil fire is a \nknockout. Gable and Tracy, who had worked together so memorably in San \nFrancisco, are a terrific match: Gable is all straight-ahead gusto, declaiming \nevery line, as Tracy underplays to crafty effect. Nice supporting parts for \nFrank Morgan and Chill Wills span the entire movie, which ends, curiously, in a \ncourtroom and a speech about capitalism.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGenerated with Cool NFO Creator - http://fly.to/coolbeans\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a48e151d64d1581ab793f579ff02a41984a9386","amp;dn":"Boom+Town+%281940%29+DVDrip_XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a48e151d64d1581ab793f579ff02a41984a9386","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,72,225,81,214,77,21,129,171,121,63,87,159,240,42,65,152,74,147,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
