While they were plundering an entire island nation, they did find time to play a few shows, most notably the last night of what seems to have been an excellent time spent.  Osaka.  September 29, 1971.\n\nI try not to spoil these shows with a full writeup.  I&amp;#039;m listening to the show now, and a few things stand out - Robert is very talkative, and speaks slowly so that the few English speakers in the audience understand.  The crowd is very polite - at one point before Stairway, Robert mentions (complains?) about the audience being so quiet.  \n\nThere are enough rarities here to make this worth collecting - legendarily &quot;Smoke Gets In Your Eyes&quot; and quite a Whole Lotta Love medley.  The sound is what I would call very good to excellent AUD - I boost everything from 1k up to about 8dB, and boost as needed with the 60hZ slider.  \n\nI always kinda considered this a must-have.  I&amp;#039;m pretty sure it&amp;#039;s got the most complete WLL, Thank You and Rock and Roll of any release of this date.  Throw in a particularly good night for John Bonham, one of the most relaxed Jimmy Page performances ever IMHO, and Plant in great voice for the last night of a tour.  \n\nBand: Led Zeppelin\nTitle: Live In Osaka\nDate: September 29, 1971\nVenue: Festival Hall, Osaka, Japan\nLabel: Night Hawk\nNumber: NH-01003/4/5\nSource: Silvers &gt; EAC &gt; WAV &gt; FLAC Frontend &gt; FLAC\n\nDisc 1\n1 Immigrant Song\n2 Heartbreaker\n3 Since I&amp;#039;ve Been Loving You\n4 Black Dog\n5 Dazed And Confused\n\nDisc 2\n1 Stairway To Heaven\n2 Celebration Day\n3 That&amp;#039;s The Way\n4 Going To California\n5 Tangerine\n6 Friends\n7 Smoke Gets In Your Eyes\n8 What Is And What Should Never Be\n9 Moby Dick\n\nDisc 3\n1 Whole Lotta Love - Boogie Woogie - Tossin&amp;#039; And Trunin&amp;#039; - Twist And Shout - Fortune Teller - Good Times Bad Times - You Shook Me\n2 Communication Breakdown\n3 Thank You\n4 Rock And Roll\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dde05f391bf54004f86aba30e09158ef27900a01","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+1971.09.29+-+Osaka","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dde05f391bf54004f86aba30e09158ef27900a01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,224,95,57,27,245,64,4,248,106,186,48,224,145,88,239,39,144,10,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
