Sorry for this, I hope you can all get this new copy.\n\n-- Info --\nThis is an undub of Crisis Core that we threw together. Can&amp;#039;t guarantee that\nall the audio replacement is right, as have yet to play through the entire\ngame. We&amp;#039;re aware &quot;Power Surge&quot; is still in English, it would be too much hassle\nto undub those, but other than that, everything should be Japanese. \n\n-- Group Message --\nWe hope you guys enjoy the awesome game the way it was meant to be played.\nWould like to give thanks to Gnie for his awesome Xpert 2 application, and \nthe UMDGen guys for their tool as well. Big thanks goes out to EMINENT for their\npre-launch release of Crisis Core, so we could get this undub out before the\nactual game is out.\n\nThis release brought to you by Drakia and Tkeil.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb1333f337641527fad8d55d034c4cb26261a116","amp;dn":"FFVII+-+Crisis+Core+UNDUB+FIX-D%26T","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb1333f337641527fad8d55d034c4cb26261a116","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,19,51,243,55,100,21,39,250,216,213,93,3,76,76,178,98,97,161,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
