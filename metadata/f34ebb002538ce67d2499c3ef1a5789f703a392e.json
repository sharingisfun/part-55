Built for your brain, this book covers Visual C# 2008, Visual Studio 2008, and the .NET Framework 3.5, and teaches everything from language fundamentals to advanced topics including garbage collection, extension methods, and double-buffered animation. You&amp;#039;ll also master C#&amp;#039;s hottest and newest syntax, LINQ, for querying your data in .NET collections, SQL databases, and more. By the time you&amp;#039;re through, you&amp;#039;ll be a proficient Visual C# programmer, designing and coding large-scale applications.\n\nEvery few chapters you will come across a lab that lets you apply what you&amp;#039;ve learned up to that point. Each lab is designed to simulate a professional programming task, increasing in complexity until-at last-you build a working Invaders game, complete with shooting ships, aliens descending while firing, and an animated death sequence for unlucky starfighters. This remarkably engaging book will have you going from zero to 60 with Visual C# in no time flat.\n\nMore info here : [url]http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596514822/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f34ebb002538ce67d2499c3ef1a5789f703a392e","amp;dn":"OReilly.Head.First.C.Sharp.Nov.2007.eBook-BBL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f34ebb002538ce67d2499c3ef1a5789f703a392e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,78,187,0,37,56,206,103,210,73,156,62,241,165,120,159,112,58,57,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
