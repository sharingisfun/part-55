They came onto the Christian metalcore scene in 1993 in Parkersburg, West Virginia, and as of 2006 they are based in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. They have now gone on record to say that they no longer consider themselves a ?christian band?, but rather a band of Christians, in the line of Johnny Cash or U2. This is partly due to some conflicts with the Christian establishment, with the singer?s home church condemning the band as music only the devil could make. Zao is currently signed with Ferret Records. They were previously signed to Solid State Records. Their new album ?The Fear Is What Keeps Us Here? was released on 6/13/06.\n\nZao is also infamously known for being a band, much like Napalm Death, of which none of the original band members remain in the lineup. Jesse Smith was the longest running band member, serving as the drummer from the original incarnation of Zao through 2003. He quit Zao before the recording of ?The Funeral of God? and formed a band named Gods who have recently disbanded. It?s only after the demise of the original lineup in 1997 (with Jesse keeping the band going at that point) that Zao recorded their first landmark release, ?Where Blood and Fire Bring Rest?. This was followed by ?Liberate Te Ex Inferis (Save Yourself From Hell)? in 1999. Many fans consider that time period the heyday of Zao, with common opinion being that those two albums were the strongest and purest Zao releases. The following two albums, 2001?s ?(Self-Titled)? and 2002?s ?Parade of Chaos?, featured a groundbreaking fusion of metalcore with subtle electronica/ambient experiments courtesy of Jesse Smith. The evolution of Zao?s sound throughout their career did have a lot of influence on the metalcore scene and that is why Zao are generally seen, not only as veterans, but also as pioneers of the actual genre.\nOther notable characteristics of Zao include one of the most melodramatic existences within the scene, with almost countless temporary breakups in addition to the aforementioned constant lineup changes. Dan Weyandt, vocalist from 1998 to the present, produces one of the most respected and envied growls of any band in the scene, and sometimes-guitarist Russ Cogdell (who recently picked up guitar duties for Zao yet again) was infamous for live performances during which he would hurl his tall, thin frame four or five feet into the air and come down on his knees, a live tradition which led to his absence from the band for several years while he underwent extensive knee surgery.\n \n \n   VA-(Split CD)-Zao-Training For Utopia-(v0-VBR)-(1998)\n   =================================================================\n   1 - Training For Utopia - Modus Operandi.mp3        \n   2 - Zao - Skin Like Winter (feat.
