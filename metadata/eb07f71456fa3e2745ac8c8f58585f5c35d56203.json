Only the Hellsing foundation stands between the evil undead and the innocent humans who would be their prey. But there\\&amp;#039;s something new out there - chips that give humans vampiric ability and bloodlust are being sold as the latest designer drug. With a new wave of evil creatures rising, Hellsing must rely on its two most unlikely recruits - ancient master vampire Alucard and the newly turned Celes Victoria - but can even they stand in the face of such overwhelming odds? \n\nNOTE: I will be seeding as much as possible, but while my brother plays xbox live during the day I might have to stop seeding until he is done. So please be patient because I will be SEEDING, it just maybe on and off throughout the day so do give up.\n\nAlso so everyone knows the VLC player is the best player to watch and switch between the dual-audio. \n\nAnd please everyone seed!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb07f71456fa3e2745ac8c8f58585f5c35d56203","amp;dn":"Hellsing+01-13+Dual-Audio+%5BECP%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb07f71456fa3e2745ac8c8f58585f5c35d56203","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,7,247,20,86,250,62,39,69,172,140,143,88,88,95,92,53,213,98,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
