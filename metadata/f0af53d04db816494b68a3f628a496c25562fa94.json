Wang et al. (CRC, 2009).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 9781420072235\r\n\r\nComprehensive in its scope and directly applicable to daily waste management problems of specific industries, Waste Treatment in the Metal Manufacturing, Forming, Coating, and Finishing Industries covers hazardous industrial waste treatment, renovation, and reuse in the metal manufacturing, forming, coating, enameling, and finishing industries. It details specific hazardous and industrial wastes from metal industries, basic and advanced principals and applications, augmented by figures, tables, examples, and case histories.\r\n\r\nThis book elucidates new industries and new waste management topics and provides all of the necessary technical information on industrial and hazardous waste treatment. Focusing on new developments in innovative and alternative technologies, it offers in-depth coverage of environmental pollution sources, waste characteristics, facility innovations, design criteria, control technologies, management strategies, process alternatives, costs, and effluent standards. It also addresses the regional and global effects of important pollution control practices specific to the process industries.\r\n\r\nSince the field of industrial hazardous waste treatment is very broad and no one can claim to be an expert in all industries, the editors have collected contributions from a wide range of experts, making the information in this handbook authoritative, inclusive, and cutting-edge. It seamlessly interweaves the traditional with the novel, covering all sectors of pollution control and delineating the need for a total environmental control program and how to achieve it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0af53d04db816494b68a3f628a496c25562fa94","amp;dn":"Waste+Treatment+in+the+Metal+Manufacturing%2C+Forming%2C+Coating%2C+an","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0af53d04db816494b68a3f628a496c25562fa94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,175,83,208,77,184,22,73,75,104,163,246,40,164,150,194,85,98,250,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
