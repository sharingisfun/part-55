You can add |\r\n| chocolate chips, nuts, or decide not to. You can make this recipe |\r\n| gluten-free. When you make your own bread, the choice is all up to you! |\r\n| |\r\n| I have even added metric measurements to this recipe, so people from all |\r\n| over the world can enjoy this course! |\r\n| |\r\n| You do not need fancy equipment to make this bread. You will need an oven, |\r\n| bread loaf pans, a few large mixing bowls, spoons, and a handheld electric|\r\n| mixer. Recommended equipment would include a kitchen scale and a stand |\r\n| mixer, but these are not required, they only speed up the process and help|\r\n| with consistency. |\r\n| |\r\n| As a bonus, I will also include a lecture on how to make your own natural |\r\n| vanilla! Vanilla is one of the most common and expensive ingredients in a |\r\n| bakers pantry. By using this lecture, you can make your own vanilla and |\r\n| save money compared to grocery store vanilla. And you know exactly where |\r\n| it came from, your own kitchen! |\r\n| |\r\n| So come and join me and other Udemy students as we learn how to bake |\r\n| together","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfc7f3155e09c1869f881f0fd2827e69f225de5e","amp;dn":"UDEMY+BAKING+ESSENTIALS++MAKE+BANANA+BREAD+TUTORIAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfc7f3155e09c1869f881f0fd2827e69f225de5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,199,243,21,94,9,193,134,159,136,31,15,210,130,126,105,242,37,222,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
