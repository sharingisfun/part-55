Their ability to craft hook-filled music that appeals to fans of bands like Taking Back Sunday, Fallout Boy, and Cartel has allowed them to garner a following in the thousands. With a work ethic that is unmatched and a determination that is unheard of, HONOR BRIGHT has been on two self-booked and self-promoted national tours promoting their cdep and their work on &quot;Build Hearts From Stars&quot; their newly self-released full length album. This hard work has allowed them the opportunity to play shows with the likes of Boys Like Girls, Anberlin, Bayside, Quietdrive, Brighten, Envy On The Coast, Powerspace, Danger:Radio, Lorene Drive, As Tall As Lions, and Damiera. The sky is the limit for HONOR BRIGHT, and they are already well off the ground. They\\&amp;#039;ll make you dance, or rock out while trying.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87d53f018e5db0765bd41a277e7a8e82fed3a437","amp;dn":"Honor+Bright+-+Build+Hearts+From+Stars+-+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87d53f018e5db0765bd41a277e7a8e82fed3a437","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,213,63,1,142,93,176,118,91,212,26,39,126,122,142,130,254,211,164,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
