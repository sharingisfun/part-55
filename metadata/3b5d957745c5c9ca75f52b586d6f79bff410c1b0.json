Architecture is x86.\n\nSETUP:\n \n(necessary) iphone-toolchain.tar.gz. There is directory named iphone-toolchain inside the archive; copy all structure from it to /usr/local/. You must put /usr/local/bin/ to your PATH environment variable:\nexport PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH\n\nAlso you must add /usr/local/lib to your /etc/ld.so.conf file.\n\n(necessary) iphone_filesystem.tar.gz. There is iphone filesystem inside (firmware 1.1.4). There is directory named \\&quot;share\\&quot; inside this archive. You must put it to /usr/local/. After this you must add environment variable named HEAVENLY:\nexport HEAVENLY=/usr/local/share/iphone-filesystem\nor:\nexport HEAVENLY=/usr/local/share/heavenly-1.1.4\n\n(optional) MacOSX10.4u.sdk.tar.gz. This is MacOS X 10.4 Universal SDK. There are some symlinks to it from iphone\\&amp;#039;s include files. You may put this directory to /usr/local/share/.\n \n(optional) iphone_uikit_template.tar.gz. I have created this template for program projects. If you want to use it, you have to replace $PROJECTNAME string in all files to your app\\&amp;#039;s name. Also you have to replace \\&quot;iPhoneApp\\&quot; to your app\\&amp;#039;s name in Makefile.\n \n(optional) kdevelop_uikit_template.tar.gz. I have created this template for KDevelop. You have to put the content of this archive to $KDEBASE (for example, /usr/, or, as I have (Gentoo Linux 2007.0), - /usr/kde/. You can get the path of $KDEBASE giving command:\nkde-config --prefix\n\n(optional) bashrc. This is the script for BASH. It sets needed environment variables when you login. You have to put this file into your home dir and rename to .bashrc.\n \nAfter setup you may check if your compiler works. You can download testing app named \\&quot;Hello World\\&quot; from here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iphonegameover.com/tutorials/basics/helloWorld/helloWorld.tar.bz2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iphonegameover.com/tutorials/basics/helloWorld/helloWorld.tar.bz2&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou can read an article about it here: http://wiki.iphonegameover.com/Hello_World_Tutorial.\n \nNOTICE: there may be problems if you compile your projects as \\&amp;#039;root\\&amp;#039;. It will be better if you will compile them as usual user (for example you can create user named \\&amp;#039;iphone\\&amp;#039;).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b5d957745c5c9ca75f52b586d6f79bff410c1b0","amp;dn":"iPhone+unofficial+SDK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b5d957745c5c9ca75f52b586d6f79bff410c1b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,93,149,119,69,197,201,202,117,245,43,88,109,111,121,191,244,16,193,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
