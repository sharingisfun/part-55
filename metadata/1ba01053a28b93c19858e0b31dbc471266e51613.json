Dutton\n\nPlot .............: 1950. Rural Alabama. Cotton harvest. It&amp;#039;s a make-or-break weekend for the Honeydripper Lounge and its owner, piano player Tyrone &quot;Pine Top&quot; Purvis. Deep in debt to the liquor man, the chicken man, and the landlord, Tyrone is desperate to lure the young cotton pickers and local Army base recruits into his juke joint, away from Touissant&amp;#039;s, the rival joint across the way. After laying off his regular talent, blues singer Bertha Mae, Tyrone announces to his sidekick Maceo that he has hired the famous electric guitar player, Guitar Sam, for a special one night only gig: pack em in and save the club. On the day of the show, the train arrives and Guitar Sam is no where to be found. Tyrone is forced to take drastic action. He makes a deal with Sheriff Pugh to release Sonny, the kid who hopped off a freight car here in Harmony, and turned up in the club claiming he could play the guitar as well as any Guitar Sam. Tyrone cleans Sonny up and launches a last ditch scheme to pass off the young guitar picker as Guitar Sam just long enough to cut the lights and run off with cash box. When Sonny takes the stage and launches into his first scalding electric licks, Tyrone will learn if it&amp;#039;s lights out for the Honeydripper or if his luck has changed: he might just be another man saved by rock n&amp;#039; roll.\n\nRls Date ......: 12 ~ 05 ~ 08\nGenre ..........: Drama ~ Music\n\nVideo .........: Xvid ~ 672x368 ~ 1100kbps\nAudio .........: AC3 5.1\nRuntime .....: 123 Minutes\nSize ............: 2CD ~ 1.39 GB\nLanguage ......: English\nSubtitles ......: N/A\n\nScreenshots - Trailer and release info all here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://releasepirate.com/2008/05/12/honeydripperlimiteddvdripxvid-bald/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://releasepirate.com/2008/05/12/honeydripperlimiteddvdripxvid-bald/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ba01053a28b93c19858e0b31dbc471266e51613","amp;dn":"Honeydripper.LIMITED.DVDRip.XViD-BaLD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ba01053a28b93c19858e0b31dbc471266e51613","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,160,16,83,162,139,147,193,152,88,224,179,29,188,71,18,102,229,22,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
