It was shot beautiful, the performances were amazing especially from Madsen, Jones, Rawley and Fitzpatrick (Mammy) and the score was fantastic. \n\nI remember reading once that the definition of art is something that provokes two opposing views. The director has certainly achieved this as people seem to love or hate, with no middle ground. \n\nThe script covers lots of ground at the start, but I believe that this is fine. When you go to the cinema, we have to use our imagination a little bit too. On that note though, this is a fictional piece, not a documentary. \n\nWell worth an hour and a half of your time!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a61929b5c0a96a35d555207da5239b1e88a4425","amp;dn":"Strength+and+Honour+%282007%29+DVDScr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a61929b5c0a96a35d555207da5239b1e88a4425","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,97,146,155,92,10,150,163,93,85,82,7,218,82,57,177,232,138,68,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
