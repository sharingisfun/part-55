If you haven&amp;#039;t heard this stuff but are a big fan, I really recommend it.  If you&amp;#039;ve only heard &quot;Float On&quot; then you&amp;#039;re going to hate this, so you might as well hit the &amp;#039;Back&amp;#039; button now.  \n\nThe first half of the album consists of full length, beautiful songs.  The quality is much worse than the newer Modest Mouse albums, but it adds to the trashy beauty of Isaac Brock&amp;#039;s style.  The second half is composed of what sounds like Brock messing around in his bedroom, recording things sporadically.  \n\nI love this album and here it is for all of you to share with me.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e183ec10072b5915d2f7d0033bb4ecf3f22b3eea","amp;dn":"Modest+Mouse+-+Sad+Sappy+Sucker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e183ec10072b5915d2f7d0033bb4ecf3f22b3eea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,131,236,16,7,43,89,21,210,247,208,3,59,180,236,243,242,43,62,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
