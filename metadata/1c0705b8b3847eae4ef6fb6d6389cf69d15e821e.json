I couldn&amp;#039;t find this on any other torrent track so here it is.\n\nIt is NOT English so here are some instructions:\n\n1. Load Live Bomber up\n\nTipo de envio:\nSelect: Floodeo\n\nThe textbox to the right? Type the message you want to spam there.\nI&amp;#039;m yet to find out what the drop down box does so leave it alone.\n\n\nThe second set of options is the amount of times to repeat it; or something to that effect. Offical translations are welcome =).\n\n\nEDIT: Forgot, select the textbox entry of the person you want to flood as you were going to type something to them, then switch to LiveBomber and hit Enviar, let the floods begin!\n\n\nALSO:\n\nHow do this look for a NFO once I&amp;#039;m done collecting some decent freeware to post?\n\n        ,&amp;#039;\\&quot;&quot;-__ \n      ,&amp;#039;   `.   `-__\n     /\\     _\\__    `-__\n    /  \\ ,-&amp;#039;  | `--___  `-__                V    A    U   G   H   A   N    D    S\n   |    |     |       `--___`-__\n   |    |     |          ___`--_&quot;&quot;                     \n   |    |     |    ___--&amp;#039;  __-&amp;#039;\n    \\  / `-._ |_--&amp;#039;    __-&amp;#039;   \n     \\/      /     __-&amp;#039;\n      `.   ,&amp;#039;  __-&amp;#039;\n        `./__-\n\n \n  All software I redistribute is not mine, nor am I the cracker/breaker. \nMost of the Software I sumbit to any bit torrent tracker is 100% freeware,\ndon&amp;#039;t let that pull you away though, not all freeware is well known about.\n Some are hidden gems we never knew we had! Some developers only post things on\nsmall unnoticed forums, some software we never knew existed.
