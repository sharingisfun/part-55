As a teenager, motivated by his love for music and the allure of Hollywood, Rodney left his home in northern California for Los Angeles, where, despite a shy, socially awkward nature, he immediately became a ubiquitous presence on the live-music circuit.\n\nA constantly evolving fixture as scenester, journalist, promoter and club owner, he eventually earned the nickname &quot;Mayor of the Sunset Strip.&quot; After a stint as Davy Jones&amp;#039; stand-in on The Monkees and a successful run as proprietor of Rodney Bingenheimer&amp;#039;s English Disco, a magnet for every major star of the early 70s, he began spinning records on Los Angeles&amp;#039; cutting-edge radio station KROQ, and soon became one of the country&amp;#039;s most influential DJs. Since then, Rodney has helped define the sounds that have dominated over three decades of music by giving dozens of major artists their first airplay. A partial list of bands he helped to break includes the Sex Pistols, the Clash, the Ramones, X, the Go-Go&amp;#039;s, Blondie, Devo, Van Halen, Nirvana, Oasis, No Doubt, and, more recently, Coldplay and the Strokes. Featuring interviews with such stars as David Bowie, Mick Jagger, Cher, Brooke Shields, Brian Wilson, Debbie Harry, Gwen Stefani, Courtney Love, Nancy Sinatra, Coldplay&amp;#039;s Chris Martin, and many others, &quot;Mayor of the Sunset Strip&quot; is a fascinating look at a life defined by a fascination with, and a Zelig-like knack for getting close to, the most famous names in music, movies, television, and beyond.\n\nGenre: Musical &amp; Performing Arts\nStarring: Rodney Bingenheimer, David Bowie, Gwen Stefani, Coldplay, Courtney Love\nDirector: George Hickenlooper\nProducer: Chris Carter, Greg Little, Tommy Perna\nComposer: Anthony Marinelli\n\nRelease Date:26 March 2004 (USA) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0230512/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0230512/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[Movie]\nName.........................: Mayor of the Sunset Strip_2003_dvdrip_ekolb\nLength.......................: 01h 34m 11s \n\n[Video]\nFormat.......................: NTSC\nOrig.
