It is the\nlatest and most complete (hence, &quot;Perfect&quot;) title in the series of Daisenryaku\n(&quot;great strategy&quot;) games. Daisenryaku games have been released for nearly every\nconsole, including SNES/Super Famicom, Genesis/Megadrive, Game Boy, Dreamcast,\nPlaystation 1 and 2, not to mention at least 7 previous editions on the PC. It\nfeatures over 700 real life military units from 16 countries, the majority\nbeing modern (post-1980&amp;#039;s) hardware. If you&amp;#039;ve played any of the older\nDaisenryaku games, or any other strategy games with a hex map like Conflict or\nAdvance Wars, you&amp;#039;ll have a good idea of what to expect. But compared to\neverything else (except the legendary Harpoon series), this game is much deeper.\n\nThe game can be played by up to 8 players on the same computer, either\ncooperatively, competitively, or a mix of both. A new feature to the series,\ngames can be played through e-mail.\n\nThe limited edition version of this game comes with a mouse pad (with nice\nartwork of a Leopard MBT), and an index booklet with most of the units in the\ngame.\n\nFAQ here.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gamefaqs.com/computer/doswin/file/918419/24340&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gamefaqs.com/computer/doswin/file/918419/24340&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:455f72f5df24648b6f3db1e78d581851aaabda2e","amp;dn":"Daisenryaku+Perfect+1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"455f72f5df24648b6f3db1e78d581851aaabda2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,95,114,245,223,36,100,139,111,61,177,231,141,88,24,81,170,171,218,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
