From the ashes of a very public split with vocalist Phil Anselmo, brothers Dimebag Darrell and Vinnie Paul took solace in a simple mantra--new found power. The duo set out to build a new band in that very spirit as a vehicle for Darrell\\&amp;#039;s trademark blistering riffs and Paul\\&amp;#039;s precision skin-bashing. Initially flying under the flag New Found Power, the band added bassist and fellow Texan Bob Zilla and became known as Damageplan.\n\nAdditional personnel includes: Zakk Wylde.\n\nDamageplan: Pat Lachman (vocals); Dimebag Darrell (guitar); Bob Zilla (bass); Vinnie Paul (drums).\n\nProducers: Vinnie Paul, Dimebag Darrell, Sterling Winfield, Pat Lachman.\n\nThis is an Enhanced CD, which contains both regular audio tracks and multimedia computer files.\n\nFormer Halford guitarist Pat Lachman makes his vocal debut on NEW FOUND POWER. The result is a study in extremes that spans the horizon from borderline death-metal vocals (\\&quot;Reborn\\&quot;) to clean melodic singing (\\&quot;Save Me\\&quot;). Pantera fans may hear echoes of their beloved band\\&amp;#039;s heyday in the thrashy abandon of \\&quot;F*** You\\&quot; and the trudging \\&quot;Moment of Truth.\\&quot; Not resting on formula, however, Damageplan explores an industrial vibe with \\&quot;Explode\\&quot; and haunting Alice in Chains inspired harmonies on \\&quot;Soul Bleed.\\&quot; An impressive first effort, NEW FOUND POWER draws a line in the sand that only serious metal enthusiasts need cross. \n \n\nplease seed wisely.. to glorify the gift of TORRENT!\nSSEEAASSOORREESS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cff5e88df2523ffc7f800df4ee8da6913b05430","amp;dn":"damageplan+new+found+power+mp3+with+1+MTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cff5e88df2523ffc7f800df4ee8da6913b05430","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,255,94,136,223,37,35,255,199,248,0,223,78,232,218,105,19,176,84,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
