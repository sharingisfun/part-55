The move towards this sort of sound started with From Within and is taken to a new level here: much of Gravity sounds like radio-friendly rock, only with lots and lots of Mellotron providing a backing for the guitar riffing and vocals. In fact, there&amp;#039;s so much Mellotron, especially in the loud sections and crescendoes, that I find it actually dulls some much-needed edge ? all too often, blazing guitar riffs are sublimated under a fuzzy haze of Mellotron. Also, Gravity&amp;#039;s turn to the accessible means that the band&amp;#039;s vocals, never a strong point, are highlighted ? most songs have quite a bit of singing, with the vocals high in the mix, and to me this is definitely not a good thing. A further change for the worse is the loss of Anna Sofi Dahlberg&amp;#039;s cello, which was already severely underused in From Within and does not appear at all here.\n\nOf all of these songs, only the opener &quot;Monolith&quot; is memorable at all. The rest of the songs evoke a nicely brooding sort of mood, but are generally inoffensive and pass by in the same sort of nondescript haze as, say, Opeth&amp;#039;s Damnation. Come to think of it, Damnation and Gravity might actually appeal to a similar audience, but unfortunately longtime fans who cut their teeth on Vemod and Nucleus may find Gravity lacking the same kind of appealing edge. Although I guess for the proggy-prog fanatics, there&amp;#039;s Mellotron. Lots and lots of freakin&amp;#039; Mellotron.\n\nReview by Brandon Wu\n\nSource: http://www.progreviews.com/reviews/display.php?rev=anek-grav","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28603399791a80f3eb3c76dd2693bee3d4e14fba","amp;dn":"Anekdoten+-+%5B2003%5D+Gravity+%28flac%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28603399791a80f3eb3c76dd2693bee3d4e14fba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,96,51,153,121,26,128,243,235,60,118,221,38,147,190,227,212,225,79,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
