The song is quite different from the usual style of Van Halen and is influenced by American country music. Eddie Van Halen recorded his guitar part on a Fender Stratocaster using a clean sound with lots of reverb which is not a tone he is famous for using. The track also featured additional guitar from the band&amp;#039;s vocalist of the time, Sammy Hagar. The music video for the song features the band playing against a plain white background with quick cuts to women dancing. On their 2004 compilation The Best of Both Worlds the track is ironically given a sudden stop mid-way through the outro (not finishing what was started) as opposed to the fade out on the OU812 version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c04bab66590828fa53cfed782fb62637f6c52ad5","amp;dn":"Van+Halen+-+Finish+What+Ya+Started","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c04bab66590828fa53cfed782fb62637f6c52ad5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,75,171,102,89,8,40,250,83,207,237,120,47,182,38,55,246,197,42,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
