He compiled soundboard recordings of his favorite performances from Neil&amp;#039;s acoustic sets in November 1976. These recordings have been widely distributed for a long time -- I believe they first appeared on vinyl under the title &quot;Last Plane Outta Here.&quot; (Vinyl is NOT the source of what I have here.)\nMost Young collectors have these recordings, but most of them have the version taken from the bootleg titled &quot;Acoustic Young,&quot; which is missing two of the 22 songs: &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; and &quot;A Man Needs a Maid.&quot;\nHere I&amp;#039;ve used the 20 tracks from &quot;Acoustic Young&quot; and inserted the missing songs in the original correct running order. Those two songs are take from the &quot;River of Pride&quot; bootleg, which I think has slightly lower sound quality compared with &quot;AY,&quot; though you may not notice it. I&amp;#039;ve equalized the volume because the stuff was taken from two sources.\nNote that although these are soundboard recordings, they are not direct from the master. The tapes were passed around between friends until someone finally bootleged them. I consider the sound to be excellent for a bootleg -- especially one from 1976 -- though it&amp;#039;s not official-release quality. It&amp;#039;s a very enjoyable disc, and I consider it to be an essential part of a good Neil Young collection.\nArtwork is included. Hope y&amp;#039;all enjoy this. And if you have some spare coin lying around, please think of donating it to the Red Cross or Salvation Army for the hurricane victims.\n\nClyde the Camel\n\n\n1. Campaigner, Boston 11/22/76 E\n2.
