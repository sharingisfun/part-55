Its a classic fo&amp;#039;sho. all 5 songs are classic, but my favorites would be My Mind Says, Bicheshate which has 2 of the funniest verses ever, 1st verse (esham) and 3rd verse (dice), and Murdaride. But the other songs Bus 1 4 Me! and Solo Kill are both awesome. Get this. Along with any other RLP album, because they are all classics and are 100% better than ANY of that b^%&amp;s#$t out there today in the mainstream.
