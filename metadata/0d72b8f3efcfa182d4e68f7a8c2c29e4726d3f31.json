After playing hundreds of small gigs, Leaf recorded their first album ?Life?s a Beach?, a live album recorded at the Dutch beach. ?Life?s a Beach? contains 11 very happy Summer songs, including the hitsingle Wonderwoman, and was released in August 2007. \n\nTheir breezy sound and ironic and animating songwriting are things very new to the public. The thing that Leaf uses to be different from the thousand other bands out there, is most definitely an allround acoustic way of playing, with no real drums but the African instruments cajon and djembe and an acoustic guitar. Eventhough there?s a bass in their music, it all sounds very acoustic and easylistening. \n\nWith Annemarie as only female and singer, Tienus as singer [and beatbox and rapper in some of the songs], Joni on bass, Ocker on acoustic guitar and Jeroen on cajon and djembe, the five of them form a funloving group that playes music most people just can?t seem to get enough of. \n\n===========================================================================\n\nEnjoy, PPKLP","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d72b8f3efcfa182d4e68f7a8c2c29e4726d3f31","amp;dn":"%5BPPKLP%5D+Leaf+-+Life%5C%27s+a+Beach+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d72b8f3efcfa182d4e68f7a8c2c29e4726d3f31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,114,184,243,239,207,161,130,212,230,143,122,140,44,41,228,114,109,63,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
