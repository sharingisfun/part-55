Now he does it again, in one of the \nwildest, most entertaining historical thrillers in years. \n\nApril 1950: The rusting hulk of a steam locomotive rises from the deep waters \nof a Montana lake. Inside is all that remains of three people who died \nforty-four years before. But it is neither the engine nor its grisly contents \nthat interests those watching nearby. It is what is about to come next.\n\n1906: For two years, the western United States have been suffering an \nextraordinary crime spree: a string of bank robberies by a single man who \nthen cold-bloodedly murders any and all witnesses, and vanishes without a \ntrace. Fed up by the depredations of &quot;The Butcher Bandit,&quot; the U.S. \ngovernment brings in the best man it can find?a tall, lean, no-nonsense \ndetective named Isaac Bell, who has caught thieves and killers from coast to \ncoast.\n\nBut he has never had a challenge like this one. From Arizona to Colorado to \nthe streets of San Francisco during its calamitous earthquake and fire, he \npursues what quickly becomes clear to him is the best criminal mind he has \never encountered, and the woman who seems to hold the key to the man&amp;#039;s \nidentity. Using science, deduction, and intuition, he repeatedly draws near, \nonly to grasp at empty air, but at least he knows his pursuit is having an \neffect. Because his quarry is getting angry now, and has turned the chase \nback on him. The hunter has become the hunted. And soon it will take all of \nBell&amp;#039;s skills not merely to prevail...but to survive.\n\nMarked by intricate plotting, Cussler&amp;#039;s signature dazzling set pieces, and not \none but two extraordinary villains, The Chase is the master working at the \nheight of his powers.\n\n----\n\nClive Cussler is the author or coauthor of thirty-three previous books, \nincluding nineteen Dirk Pitt novels, most recently Treasure of Khan; seven \nNUMA Files adventures, most recently The Navigator; and four Oregon Files \nbooks, most recently Skeleton Coast. His nonfiction works include The Sea \nHunters and The Sea Hunters II; these describe the true adventures of the \nreal NUMA, which, led by Cussler, searches for ships of historic significance. \nWith his crew of volunteers, Cussler has discovered more than sixty ships, \nincluding the long-lost Confederate submarine Hunley. He lives in Arizona.\n\n----\n\nScott Brick is an actor and writer who has appeared on film, television and \nradio, and onstage. He can be heard on the audiobooks Treasure of Khan, \nSkeleton Coast, Dark Watch, Polar Shift, Trojan Odyssey, Black Wind, and \nThe Navigator.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b00c639b4013ac78fd0e6cf684d417991d5f5cc","amp;dn":"Clive+Cussler+-+The+Chase","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b00c639b4013ac78fd0e6cf684d417991d5f5cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,0,198,57,180,1,58,199,143,208,230,207,104,77,65,121,145,213,245,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
