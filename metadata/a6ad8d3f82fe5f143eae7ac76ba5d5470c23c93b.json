I have to use these measures because replacing the files is the only thing that seemed to work.  I&amp;#039;ve replaced the files myself and it worked for me so heres what you do.....\n\nAfter downloading the files just copy the new 2moons folder you just aquired to where the old 2Moons file is so basically you copy it to C:\\Program Files\\Acclaim.\n\nJust to clarify.....when you copy its gonna ask to replace and then click the yes to all button cause your copying the same named folder. \n\nI didn&amp;#039;t know which files were the problem for the cannot connect to server error so i just had to add the whole thing.  It worked for me hope it works for you\n\n\n\nAny questions IM me on AIM......sn = joshs5391","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6ad8d3f82fe5f143eae7ac76ba5d5470c23c93b","amp;dn":"2Moons+files","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6ad8d3f82fe5f143eae7ac76ba5d5470c23c93b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,173,141,63,130,254,95,20,62,174,122,199,107,165,213,71,12,35,201,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
