Leo \n\ndiscusses the effects of the manipulations of both the European Illuminati &amp; the \n\nJesuits on his life that led to his return to the Monte Carlo Lodge. He affirms that \n\nthis situation can be turned to his advantage in his stated mission to introduce a \n\nlarge amount of overt transparency to the machinations of those factions of the \n\nIlluminati whose support he says he has &amp; is trying to expand.\n\nLeo still maintains that he is against the Vatican &amp; the Jesuits, the latter he \n\nblames for contriving conditions that led to his marriage breakup. We find out more \n\nabout Leo?s esoteric outlook &amp; I quiz him on many confusing &amp; concerning statements. \n\nAlso discussed is the criticism regarding Leo?s agenda in some quarters of the New \n\nWorld Order conspiracy research world. Few opportunities are missed for Leo to \n\nindulge in his unique brand of dark humour.\n\nNote: Throughout the interview Leo refers to ?the Order?. He later posted the \n\nfollowing email to clarify what he is using this term to refer to.\nTHE ORDER?\nFrom: leo young (&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;9ff3faf0e6f0eaf1f8aea6a6a6dfe6fef7f0f0b1fcf0f2&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;)\nSent: 10 May 2008 23:49:29\nTo: troy\n\nWhen Im refering to the Order in your interview Im\ntalking about the Knights Templars though as we know\nthe Jesuits have been closely linked to the Knight\nTemplar untill now, especialy after their creation of\nthe Charter of Larmenius in 1705 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larmenius_Charter&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larmenius_Charter&lt;/a&gt;\nthis infamous Charter was a complete fabrication of\nthe Jesuits and that?s a real problem at present\nwithin Templar circles.\nSome very interesting info on the Knights Templar of\nDon Fernando Campello Pinto Pereira de Sousa Fontes\nanother illustrius member of the Monte Carlo Lodge in\nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.knighttemplar.org/LarmeniusCharter.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.knighttemplar.org/LarmeniusCharter.pdf&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Jesuits also helped creating the rituals for a few\nof the degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish\nRite , and that?s another problem for us now , as we\ndont want to deal anymore with the Jesuit General but\nstill want to keep the Rite as strong as always but\npossibly free of any external influence from the\nVatican enemy.\n\nFraternal Regards,\nLeo Lyon Zagami\nLiberty Lodge No1\nKansas City\n\nINTERVIEWER?S STATEMENT TO FELLOW RESEARCHERS &amp; LISTENERS:\n\nIn this informal, impromptu interview Leo was recorded in the context of a fairly \n\nrelaxed, non-live-on-air environment, resulting in his speaking as candidly as \n\npossible, which will hopefully provide a lot more information on which to base \n\nconclusions. Hopefully more recordings will be possible &amp; made available. I feel that \n\nit is better to maintain an openness of communications with Leo, one way or the \n\nother.\n\nMy only motivation for recording this interview is to have as much information as \n\npossible on which to form my own understanding of what?s going on &amp; to allow for \n\nothers to be in a position to form theirs. It is not to subvert, infiltrate or \n\npropagandise. I have no radio ratings or listenership to worry about, no funding or \n\nany other related matters that are of concern in this regards.\n\nI?ll also take this opportunity to state that even though we discuss matters of his \n\npersonal belief &amp; understanding that aren?t my own, I wanted Leo to be able to make \n\nstatements that were as clear as possible on these matters.\n\nIn truth &amp; awareness -\n\nTroy -\n2008 05 09: TROY INTERVIEWS LEO LYON ZAGAMI #3 - 200 MINS.\n\nPLEASE CLICK THE FOLLOWING U.R.L.
