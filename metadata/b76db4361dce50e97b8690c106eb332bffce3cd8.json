Kennedy Montgomery is a libertarian that you may recognize from 90's MTV, Stossel, and the Independents.\r\n\r\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\r\n\r\nTrump is getting his ass whooped in Iowa by Ben Carson. But that's just Iowa. Doesn't matter for Trump though - he's going after Carson with the same vitriol he's aimed at everyone else he considered a rival.\r\n\r\nHere to continue to talk about the Trump v Carson battle us BONNIE McFARLAND, JULIE BANDERAS, and DAVE SMITH. The Hillary Clinton campaign has came out with 5 different DIY costumes for people who ironically (hopefully) want to be her for Halloween. A new poll shows that college students are more then willing to accept censorship in the form of speech codes.\r\n\r\nWILLIE ROBERTSON of Duck Dynasty is here in studio. Among the topics - he's a big fan of Trump (but his first love is Jindal), inheritance, and his book American Hunter.\r\n\r\nTOPICAL STORM\r\n\r\nOur panel returns to talk about &quot;hard worker&quot; being an offensive word. Melissa Harris Perry recently went on a bit of a rant about it. (She thinks it is offensive.) A hell of a Chinese women goes to town on her bastard cheating ex-husband's car with a hammer. She goes to town.\r\n\r\nTIKI BARBER is here for getting freaky with Tiki. But not really though. They're mostly just going to talk about Hardy of the Cowboys and his violent outbursts.\r\n\r\nNightcap: Kennedy hits the street with a new quiz.
