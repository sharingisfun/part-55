Measure the performance, scan for errors, securely delete all data, recover files and create a bit-for-bit identical backup with a quick and easy to use interface.\n\n\nInfo\nThe Info function shows various interesting information such as detailed device capacity, file system, operating system and USB configuration. \n\nError Scan\nA fast but reliable function to check the integrity of the device by performing a read or write surface scan. \n\nEraser\nThe memory device can be completely erased (wiped) or it can be erased quickly. \n\nFile Recovery\nQuickly and effectively recover files which were lost after a format, hardware failure or an accidental deletion. Many file types are supported.\n\nBackup/restore\nIn only a few minutes you can make a full backup of your memory device. \n\nLow-level benchmark\nMeasure the read and write performance. \n\nFile benchmark\nMeasure how long it will take to read or write files of various lengths to the device.\n\n\n\n\nThe Package contains a first version of the program made portable w/ the batch file that launches the program converted to an EXE with QBFC to avoid showing the relative DOS window, but that some AVs see sometimes as a virus. If your AV is one of them, or if you don&amp;#039;t trust too much to it, use the second one that runs directly the batch file. You will have the sloppy DOS window in the background but less complaints from antiviruses...\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a37d6220a4c34dc51a86db05904f3c309c192720","amp;dn":"Flash+Memory+Toolkit+v1.20+Portable.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a37d6220a4c34dc51a86db05904f3c309c192720","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,125,98,32,164,195,77,197,26,134,219,5,144,79,60,48,156,25,39,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
