Their rich brand of Melodic Hard Rock with a keen classic flavor early on in the band&amp;#039;s career earned the quintet a host of admirers. Taking its name from the infamous 30&amp;#039;s gangster Jack &amp;#039;Legs&amp;#039; Diamond&amp;#039;, this Los Angeles act was initially founded in 1972 bassist Michael Gargano and drummer Jeff Poole.\n\nIt would be 1974 before the first real line-up of the band would be recognized. Having become dissatisfied with their front man, a man only identified as Greg, the band advertised for a fresh vocalist and coincidentally bumped into Rick Sanford also advertising for a band to front. Before long Sanford&amp;#039;s position in LEGS DIAMOND was assured alongside keyboard player Michael Prince and Detroit born guitarist Roger Romeo, a late replacement for Donovan McKitty.\n\n\nArtist: Legs Diamond\nAlbum: A Diamond Is A Hard Rock\nRelease Date: 2001\nOriginal Release: 1977\nBitrate: 256\nFile Size: 72.4 MB\n\n1.
