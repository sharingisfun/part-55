They were signed to Maverick Records in 1999, and recorded their self-titled debut with producer, Toby Wright in 2000. The record was released in February 2001, which debuted at #193 on the Billboard 200. The record eventually went platinum, largely on the strength of the single &quot;Breakdown&quot; and the band&amp;#039;s extensive touring with the likes of Kid Rock and Creed. The song &quot;Breakdown&quot; would also eventually be selected for an opening scene to an episode of the gritty cop drama &quot;The Shield&quot;. Follow-up singles &quot;Astounded&quot; and a remixed version of &quot;Mourning&quot; also fared well.\nTrack listing\n\n  1.

Described as heavier than their first record, &quot;After We Go&quot; debuted at #56 on the Billboard 200. Unfortunately, the album did not match the success of their debut, in part due to the poor reception of follow-up singles (the title track &quot;After We Go,&quot; and their cover of Fleetwood Mac&amp;#039;s &quot;The Chain&quot;.\nTrack listing\n\n  1. &quot;Chasing After&quot;\n  2. &quot;After We Go&quot;\n  3. &quot;Falling Away&quot;\n  4. &quot;Hey Now&quot;\n  5. &quot;Hero&quot;\n  6. &quot;The Chain&quot;\n  7. &quot;Change the World&quot;\n  8. &quot;Just Once&quot;\n  9. &quot;Relentless&quot;\n 10. &quot;Alright&quot;\n 11. &quot;Before&quot;\n 12. &quot;Awake&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5d1b020539679a2bc7a7e71b519230afebada64","amp;dn":"Tantric+-+First+2+Albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5d1b020539679a2bc7a7e71b519230afebada64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,209,176,32,83,150,121,162,188,122,126,113,181,25,35,10,254,186,218,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
