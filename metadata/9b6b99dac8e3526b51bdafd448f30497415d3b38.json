A lot of over-the-top humorous moments have been removed fromt he movie to give you finally a true Indiana Jones movie, much more fitting to the rest of the series.\n\noriginal film name: Indiana Jones and the temple of doom\nfilm studio name: Lucasfilm/Paramount\nDate Original Film Was Released: 23-May-84\nDate Edit Was Released: 23-Aug-06\nOriginal Runtime: 118 min\nNew Runtime: 113 min\nAmount of time Cut/Added: 5 minute cut\nCuts removed/added/extended:\n\n* Some of Willie?s screams were removed from the audio mix.\n* Some bad lines and over-the-top Willie hysterics were removed.\n* The ?gross-out? moments were removed from the dinner scene\n\nDVD - Features:\n\n1. 113 min NTSC\n2. static menu\n\nConceptual improvements/advancements of edit over original: This edit removes about five minutes worth of ?over the top? moments from the infamous second installment in the Indiana Jones movies. It lessens some of Willie?s most obnoxious hysterics and one-liners, and removes most of the gratuitous ?ickiness? during the dinner scene which detracts from the actual revelation of the plot. The result is a more streamlined film with a somewhat stronger female character, yet it doesn?t betray her fish-out-of-water nature throughout the film. In the past I?ve joked that I can?t wait for Indy IV so there will finally be a trilogy. But now I find this movie (which was not all that bad, it just had some severe misguidance) quite watchable. Hopefully you will too.\n\nTime needed for the edition 3 days\n\nFanedit Community:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.avpsgallery.fanedit.org/index.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.avpsgallery.fanedit.org/index.php&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.fanedit.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.fanedit.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://WWW.forum.fanedit.org/index.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://WWW.forum.fanedit.org/index.php&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.originaltrilogy.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.originaltrilogy.com&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b6b99dac8e3526b51bdafd448f30497415d3b38","amp;dn":"Indiana+Jones+and+the+temple+of+doom%3AThe+ADM+Cut","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b6b99dac8e3526b51bdafd448f30497415d3b38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,107,153,218,200,227,82,107,81,189,175,212,72,243,4,151,65,93,59,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
