One unknown or in disguise, or under an assumed character or name.\n   2. The assumption of disguise or of a feigned character; the state of being in disguise or not recognized.\n\nIncognito is an open source LiveDistro based on Gentoo Linux assisting you to securely and anonymously use the Internet almost anywhere you go, e.g. your home, work, university, favourite Internet cafe or local library. Incognito can be used from either a CD or a USB drive and has several Internet applications (Web browser, IRC client, Mail client, Instant messenger, etc.) pre-configured with security in mind, and all Internet traffic will be anonymized. To use it, you simply insert the CD or USB that you have installed Incognito on in a computer and restart it. Incognito should then start as an independent operating system instead of Microsoft Windows or whatever operating system you have installed. It is also possible to run Incognito as a guest operating system inside Microsoft Windows by simply inserting the media while Windows is running which should present you with a menu.\n\nIncognito is Free Software released under the GNU/GPL (version 2).\n\n--------------------------\n\nWhy do you need anonymity?\n\nIn case you didn&amp;#039;t know, we currently find ourselves in a state of steady decline of our freedoms and privacy, with increasing levels of mass surveillance and repression all over the world (see this report from Privacy International). Without taking any precautions, your Internet service provider, the state, the police and global surveillance systems like ECHELON (which is not a conspiracy theory; see this report from the European Parliament) can record what you do online: what you read, what you write and who you communicate with. This is possible since all messages sent over the Internet contain the IP addresses of both the sender and receiver, much like an ordinary mail sent through the postal system contain addresses of both sender and receiver for two-way communication. IP addresses can easily be traced back to the physical location of the computers and their owners, and from that ultimately back to you.\nHow does Incognito provide with anonymity?\n\nFirst of all, true anonymity is impossible. Given enough resources an attacker will get you. What one can do is to make the cost of doing that so high that it becomes infeasable. Incognito tries to do this by sending all your Internet traffic through the TorÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ network which makes your Internet traffic very hard to trace. So if someone tries to trace you when you are using Incognito, the trail will stop somewhere in Tor network with the IP address of some of its participants, not your. Similarly, if someone tried to see where you ultimately want to send your traffic, they will only reach as far as some computer in the Tor network. In fact, you will be the only one knowing exactly what is going onÃƒÂ¢?? not even the computers in the Tor network that you send your traffic through will know the whole picture!\n\nAs at least a rudimentary understanding of Tor currently is essential for using it securely (and knowing its limits) we strongly recommend reading the Tor overview and Understanding and Using Tor - An Introduction for the Layman. Also see the note about common misconceptions about the service offered by the Tor software below.\nFeatures\n\n    * Common Internet applications pre-configured for anonymous use.\n    * Transparent network filtering which anonymizes all Internet traffic without any configuration needed (TCP only, though).\n    * Should run on most modern computers (otherwise please consider sending a bug report to help us further improve Incognito).\n    * Comes in two sizes:\n          o Incognito Full at ~350 MB, featuring many Internet related applications and security tools using KDE as desktop environment.\n          o Incognito Tiny at less than 50 MB, a minimal installation using the Fluxbox windows manager, suitable for business card sized CDs and smaller USB drives. [The development of the tiny version is currently halted] \n    * Ability to run from USB with persistent user settings and file storage, and optional password protected encryption, including TrueCrypt hidden volumes for plausible deniability.\n    * Publish web sites anonymously as Tor Hidden Services when running from USB with persistent file storage (see above).\n    * Virtualization - run Incognito Full within Microsoft Windows without the need to restart the computer.\n    * Anonymous email with Mixminion on Incognito Full.\n    * Option to randomize your network cards&amp;#039; MAC addresses when connected to untrusted networks.\n    * Secure deletion of system memory content on shut down to prevent forensic analysis.\n    * Except for some drivers (which should be OK) all software used by Incognito, including Incognito itself, is open source software and thus open for inspection for bugs, backdoors and bad design features unlike most proprietary software.\n\n--------------------------\n\nA note of caution\n\nAs Incognito relies heavily on the services offered by the Tor software, and there are many misconceptions about what kind of security that implies, we would like to warn you about the fact that by simply using the Tor software (as Incognito does per default) your communications should only be considered to be untraceable back to the computer you used, not encrypted or in any other way hidden. While the traffic is encrypted when it leaves your computer and when you get back your responses, it will not be so when sent between the Tor network and your destination. This means that an eavesdropper at some later point will be able see your traffic without Tor&amp;#039;s encryption, but will not be able to link it back to your computer.\n\nAs such, if you are sending or receiving sensitive data whose disclosure would be damaging in itself even if it is untraceable, you need to use end-to-end encryption to hide the meaning of your data to everyone except the recipient. Examples of such sensitive information that you need to protect in this way are your real identity or other information linkable to you, login details and passwords, bank account or financial details, anything illegal or political, and secrets in general.\n\nThere are several tools bundled with Incognito offering end-to-end encryption for various applications: Enigmail/GnuPG provides with encryption for email, OTR is for instant messaging (MSN, ICQ etc.) among others. Also, bear in mind that web browsing on sites for whom the addresses begin with &quot;http://&quot; are not encrypted and thus dangerous to transmit sensitive information to, but those starting with &quot;https://&quot; (notice the additional s) are encrypted and thus secure (many web browsers also display a lock or a similar symbol in the address field or status bar indicating that the connection is secure).\n\nFurthermore, many applications have services without the scope of the Tor software threat model. All modern web browsers, such as Firefox, offer JavaScript, Adobe Flash, Cookies and other services which have been shown to be able to defeat the anonymity provided by the Tor software. For instance, a web page using JavaScript can make your web browser send your real IP address to the web server hosting the web page which possibly can dosclose it not only to the web server&amp;#039;s owner but also eavesdroppers that happen to fetch the message when it is sent from the Tor network to the web server. Even if most web pages using JavaScript does not do this, it is important to be vary cautious when determining which sites you allow to use these extra features. In Incognito all such features are disabled in Firefox but can easily be enabled on a per page basis with the NoScript and CS Lite addons.
