The product, renamed Google Earth in 2005, \nis currently available for use on personal computers running Microsoft Windows \n2000, XP, or Vista, Mac OS X 10.3.9 and above, Linux (released on June 12, \n2006), and FreeBSD. In addition to releasing an updated Keyhole based client, \nGoogle also added the imagery from the Earth database to their web based mapping \nsoftware. The release of Google Earth caused a more than tenfold increase in \nmedia coverage on virtual globes between 2005 and 2006,[3] driving public \ninterest in geospatial technologies and applications. The viewer displays \nhouses, the color of cars, and even the shadows of people and street signs. The \ndegree of resolution available is based somewhat on the points of interest, but \nmost land (except for some islands) is covered in at least 15 meters of \nresolution.[4] Las Vegas, Nevada and Cambridge, Massachusetts include examples \nof the highest resolution, at 15 cm (6 inches). Google Earth allows users to \nsearch for addresses (for some countries only), enter coordinates, or simply use \nthe mouse to browse to a location.\n\nGoogle Earth also uses digital elevation model (DEM) data collected by NASAÃƒÂ¢??s \nShuttle Radar Topography Mission. This means one can view the Grand Canyon or \nMount Everest in three dimensions, instead of 2D like other map programs/sites. \nSince November 2006, the 3D views of many mountains, including Mount Everest, \nhave been improved by the use of supplementary DEM data to fill the gaps in SRTM \ncoverage.[5]\n\nMany people using the applications are adding their own data and making them \navailable through various sources, such as the BBS or blogs mentioned in the \nlink section below. Google Earth is able to show all kinds of images overlaid on \nthe surface of the earth and is also a Web Map Service client. Google Earth \nsupports managing three-dimensional Geospatial data through Keyhole Markup \nLanguage (KML). Google Earth has the capability to show 3D buildings and \nstructures (such as bridges), which consist of usersÃƒÂ¢?? submissions using \nSketchUp, a 3D modeling program. In prior versions of Google Earth (before \nVersion 4), 3D buildings were limited to a few cities, and had poorer rendering \nwith no textures. Many buildings and structures from around the world now have \ndetailed 3D structures; including (but not limited to) those in the United \nStates, Canada, Ireland, India, Japan, United Kingdom,[6] Germany, Pakistan and \nthe cities, Amsterdam and Alexandria.\n\nSky mode\nIn version 4.2, released August 22, 2007, Google Earth added a Sky tool for \nviewing stars and astronomical images.[9] Google Sky is produced by Google \nthrough a partnership with the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, \nthe science operations center for Hubble. Dr. Alberto Conti and his co-developer \nDr. Carol Christian of the Space Telescope Science Institute, plan to add the \npublic images from 2007,[10] as well as color images of all of the archived data \nfrom HubbleÃƒÂ¢??s Advanced Camera for Surveys. Newly released Hubble pictures will \nbe added to the Google Sky program as soon as they are issued. New features such \nas multi-wavelength data, positions of major satellites and their orbits as well \nas educational resources will be provided to the Google Earth community and also \nthrough Christian and ContiÃƒÂ¢??s website for Sky. Also visible on Sky mode are \nconstellations, stars, galaxies and animations depicting the planets in their \norbits. A real-time Google Sky mashup of recent astronomical transients, using \nthe VOEvent protocol, is being provided by the VOEventNet collaboration.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Install Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\niNSTALL CRACK IN THE DEFAULT DIRECTORY THEN ACTIVATE IT!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f44c296f48b6245428a5950f05e689e79a57bb8b","amp;dn":"Google.Earth.Pro.v4.2.0205.5730.Final","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f44c296f48b6245428a5950f05e689e79a57bb8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,76,41,111,72,182,36,84,40,165,149,15,5,230,137,231,154,87,187,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
