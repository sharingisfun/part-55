But now he\\&amp;#039;s up against something a bit different. \nBorn Survivor puts Bear in situations that could happen to anybody, \nanytime and proves how easy it is to be caught by surprise in life and death situations. \n\nBorn Survivor - Sahara: A two-hour feature length special in the Sahara where Bear shows what it takes to survive the blistering heat, \ndeadly sand storms and lack of food and water in what is one of the most hostile places on earth. \nUsing his skills and adopting little known techniques used by indigenous tribes he encounters along the way, \nBear takes on the Sahara and demonstrates that the unthinkable can, \nat times, be lifesaving. He devours lizards and scorpions, \ndrinks water from a camel\\&amp;#039;s rumen (stomach compartment) and demonstrates what to do if caught in deadly quicksand. \nForthcoming DVDs take Bear to the darkest jungles of Panama and the fierce glacial terrain of Patagonia. \nThis is a series of tough challenging environments where having the right skills and knowledge can mean the difference between life and death.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29155889ca3fb3ff2e930338b31c0c3ad12af69c","amp;dn":"Bear+Grylls+-+Sahara+-+P1-+2008%5BDVDrip%5D+%5BENG%5D+-+Y2D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29155889ca3fb3ff2e930338b31c0c3ad12af69c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,21,88,137,202,63,179,255,46,147,3,56,179,28,12,58,209,42,246,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
