It is the darkest thing in the universe and its gravity is so powerful that not even light can escape. Most start out as brilliant stars which, after millions of years, eventually collapse forming a bottomless pit from which there is no escape.\n\nThe story of Black Holes - what they are, where we may find them, and how we may harness their energy to journey through time and space. Narrated by actor John Hurt and directed by award-winning documentary filmmaker Richard Smith, the program is a journey into interstellar space to explore these mysterious &quot;prisons of light&quot;, via an imaginary computer-generated space ship. Guides for the journey include Professor Stephen Hawking, Britain&amp;#039;s Astronomer Royal Sir Martin Rees, and Homer Simpson. The program also examines the history surrounding black holes, from the first conception of them in 1859 to the present day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: XviD MPEG-4 codec\nVideo Bitrate: 1696 KB/s\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.79:1\nVideo Resolution: 688 x 384\nAudio Codec: FAST Multimedia AG DVM (Dolby AC3)\nAudio BitRate: 192 KB/s (CBR)\nAudio Channels: 2 Ch\nRunTime: 00:55\nFramerate: 25 FPS\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 744 MB\nRipped by gavin63\nSubtitles: NO TV Rip\nSource: DVB\n\nRelease Notes\nEnjoy &amp; help seed thanks\n\nRelated Documentaries\nBeyond the Milky Way [1] [2] \nCosmos\nCosmic Fireballs\nDeath of the sun [1] [2] \nPlanets [1] [2] \nSpace\nSun\nMoon\nElegant Universe [1] [2]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ec979ab53632abca98dc123734851b52f198b87","amp;dn":"Equinox+Black.Holes.DVB.Xvid.AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ec979ab53632abca98dc123734851b52f198b87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,201,121,171,83,99,42,188,169,141,193,35,115,72,81,181,47,25,139,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
