Schulke\nXoanon Publications 2005\n\n--\nAn extensive grimorium of Wortcunning, or herb-magic, the Pleasure-Garden  treats of the secret knowledge of trees and herbs as delivered by the Fallen Angels unto mank. The book&amp;#039;s principal concerns are the sorcery and gnosis of the Greenwood, as arising from the varied luminaries of the Eternal Gardens of the Arte Magical. As a grimoire of Spiritual Botany, the Book is a Hortus Conclusus of text and image intended for the indwelling of these plant-spirits. The work encompasses magical practices, formulae, and mystical exegesis, all treating the respective arcana of Nature-Spirits and the powers of individual plants. Magical foci are on devotion, purity, humility, silence, solitude, and the hieros-gamos of wortcunner and plant as a tutelary relationship, in conjunction with the Mysteries of Cain, first tiller of the soil. The whole is intended as a textual reification of occult herbalism within the context of the Sabbatic Craft Tradition.\n\nPublished November 1, 2005\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f78b9165f1c987cfe5586968c65848254a0e300c","amp;dn":"%28digimob%29+Viridarium+Umbris%3A+The+Pleasure+Garden+of+Shadow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f78b9165f1c987cfe5586968c65848254a0e300c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,139,145,101,241,201,135,207,229,88,105,104,198,88,72,37,74,14,48,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
