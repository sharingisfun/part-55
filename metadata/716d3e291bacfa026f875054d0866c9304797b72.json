The items include big head doorman, indoor and outdoor edible trees and plants, Harley fixer-upper, HMV (humvee) set, pay toilet, newspaper box, and a few very cool self-improvements and enhancements.  The improvements/enhancements could be considered cheats, since they tweak certain stats, etc., so if you don&amp;#039;t want to use cheat type things, don&amp;#039;t use those.\n\nUnzip files to C:\\MyDocuments\\EA Games\\Downloads. If there isn&amp;#039;t a &quot;Downloads&quot; folder, you can create one. There can be sub-folders in the downloads folder, or you can just dump all the files loose in the downloads folder.\n\nEach zip file has a picture of the item and a description in the readme file.  The readme actually has valuable information about each item, so you might want to read them.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:716d3e291bacfa026f875054d0866c9304797b72","amp;dn":"The+Sims+2+-+SimSlice+Donation+Items+-+No+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"716d3e291bacfa026f875054d0866c9304797b72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,109,62,41,27,172,250,2,111,135,80,84,208,134,108,147,4,121,123,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
