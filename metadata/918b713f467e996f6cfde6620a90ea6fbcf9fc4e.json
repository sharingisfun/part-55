With each case, Poirot further proves his reputation as the greatest mind in detective fiction. In &quot;The Plymouth Express,&quot; the body of the daughter of a wealthy American industrialist is found stuffed under a train seat. &quot;Problem at Sea&quot; finds a disliked rich woman murdered in a locked room on a ship. &quot;The King of Clubs&quot; involves a prince, his dancer fiancÃƒÂ©e, and a fiendish bit of blackmail. These gems are alternately read by David Suchet and Hugh Fraser, whose roles as, respectively, Poirot and his sidekick, Captain Hugh Hastings, in PBS?s Mystery! series and the Arts and Entertainment?s Poirot series are considered definitive. \n\nPlease seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:918b713f467e996f6cfde6620a90ea6fbcf9fc4e","amp;dn":"Poirot%5C%27s+Early+Cases+%2864kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"918b713f467e996f6cfde6620a90ea6fbcf9fc4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,139,113,63,70,126,153,111,108,253,230,98,10,144,234,111,188,249,252,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
