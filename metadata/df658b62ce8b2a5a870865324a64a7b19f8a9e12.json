But then it started to get better about 50 minutes into the movie because things start to happen that are relatively entertaining, but some of the scenes are really unnecessary at times. Altogether I give this a 6 out of 10 because it started slow but got a little better and it had a solid ending too. I wouldn\\&amp;#039;t recommend it, but if u want to see a thriller and your bored, then go ahead and give it a chance because Gillian Anderson pulls off a pretty good performance as a victim out for revenge.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df658b62ce8b2a5a870865324a64a7b19f8a9e12","amp;dn":"Straightheads+%282007%29+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df658b62ce8b2a5a870865324a64a7b19f8a9e12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,101,139,98,206,139,42,90,135,8,101,50,74,100,167,177,159,138,158,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
