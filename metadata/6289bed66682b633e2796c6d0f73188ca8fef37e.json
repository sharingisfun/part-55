Fuller pulls some absolutely great performances out of his cast. Everyone delivers the goods. Each character is so wild and outlandish while the actors playing them still maintain believability. Peter Breck is outstanding in the lead. All of the patients are either hysterically funny or scary funny, from Stuart (Rosco P. Coltrane in a memorable role) on down to Pagliacci. But the real standout in the movie is Hari Rhodes in the role of Trent, the white supremecist. His flawless performance disturbs me (you\\\\\\&amp;#039;ll know if you\\\\\\&amp;#039;ve seen the movie). He could be the best actor ever. What else can I say about this movie, it\\\\\\&amp;#039;s an insanely perfect pulp piece. Shock Corridor is an unreal experience, film noir at its best, and truly a cult movie.\n\nFile: shock corridor (rus)(en).avi\nComment: mix by nomove\nFilesize: 1217.54 Mb ( 1ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â 276ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â 682ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â 240 bytes )\nPlay length: 01:35:58.879 (143972 frames)\nSubtitles: Not Present\nVideo: 640x480 (1.33:1), 25 fps, DivX Codec 5.x or 6.x ~1498 kbps avg, 0.20 bit/pixel\nAudio #1: 48 kHz, MPEG Layer 3, 2 ch, ~128.00 kbps avg (rus)\nAudio #2: 48 kHz, MPEG Layer 3, 2 ch, ~128.00 kbps avg (en)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6289bed66682b633e2796c6d0f73188ca8fef37e","amp;dn":"shock+corridor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6289bed66682b633e2796c6d0f73188ca8fef37e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,137,190,214,102,130,182,51,226,121,108,109,15,115,24,140,168,254,243,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
