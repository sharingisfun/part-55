One Step Closer \n\n\nShow Notes:\n- There was nothing over &amp;#039;Points Of Authority&amp;#039;. Mike simply pumped up the crowd as he had a few times before. &amp;#039;There They Go&amp;#039; was over the outro. \n- Another shortened setlist, based off of Set T. The band added &amp;#039;Shadow Of The Day&amp;#039; back after the night before, where it was the first show the band has not played the song since the first Projekt Revolution 2007 show. &amp;#039;Valentine&amp;#039;s Day&amp;#039; was added back also. &amp;#039;Lying From You&amp;#039; was moved down to go after &amp;#039;Wake&amp;#039; since it&amp;#039;s been doing that the past few shows. &amp;#039;Given Up&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;No More Sorrow&amp;#039; are still missing. \n- On &amp;#039;Bleed It Out&amp;#039;, Brad starts off with the guitar part from the end, then Mike comes in under it and Chester does the chorus. The verse then follows. This also is the first time that the band does the singalong &quot;Ohh ohh&quot; part in a while.
