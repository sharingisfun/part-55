CARRIER follows a core group of film participants aboard the USS Nimitz, from the admiral of the strike group to the fighter pilots to the youngest sailors, as they navigate personal conflicts around their jobs, families, faith, patriotism, love, the rites of passage and the war on terror.\n\nExecutive Producer: Mel Gibson\n\nEpisode Four: Squared Away\n\nMentoring and camaraderie are what hold the ship together. Deployment is stressful for everyone aboard, and there can be friction between enlisted personnel and their superiors. Port calls, like Guam in this episode, allow sailors to blow off steam, but they don't relieve all the pressure.\n\nRelease Info:\nSource......: W4F and SoS HDTVRips\nLength......: 00:55:60\nVideo.......: XviD 1611kb/s 23.976fps 624x352\nAudio.......: 120kb/s MP3 48000Hz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67dba963a2cbf35dad481ef60594f8f5b8076c97","amp;dn":"Aviation+Carrier+2008+4of10+Squared+Away+HDTV+xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67dba963a2cbf35dad481ef60594f8f5b8076c97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,219,169,99,162,203,243,93,173,72,30,246,5,148,248,245,184,7,108,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
