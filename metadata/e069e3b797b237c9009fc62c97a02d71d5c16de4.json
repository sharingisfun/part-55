In the late 1980s the orphaned Karl Koch invests his heritage in a flat and a home computer. At first he dials up to bulletin boards to discuss conspiracy theories inspired by his favorite novel, R.A. Wilson&amp;#039;s &quot;Illuminatus&quot;, but soon he and his friend David start breaking into government and military computers. Pepe, one of Karl&amp;#039;s rather criminal acquaintances senses that there is money in computer cracking - he travels to east Berlin and tries to contact the KGB.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e069e3b797b237c9009fc62c97a02d71d5c16de4","amp;dn":"23+-+Nichts+ist+so+wie+es+scheint+%5BGER%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e069e3b797b237c9009fc62c97a02d71d5c16de4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,105,227,183,151,178,55,201,0,159,198,44,151,160,45,113,213,193,109,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
