Of course, this game is filled with warped \nand off-color humor. \nFor example, a fart sound denotes toggling between menu choices and a tally for\nquantity of helpless animals killed. \nYou weren&amp;#039;t expecting this game to be politically correct, were you?\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nInFo:\nPublisher: Acclaim\nDeveloper: Acclaim\nESRB: MATURE\nESRB Descriptors: Comic Mischief, Strong Language \n\nSystem: PII 266 or equivalent\nRAM: 32 MB\nVideo Memory: 4 MB\nHard Drive Space: 95 MB  \n\nReview; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/southpark/index.html?tag=result;title;2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/southpark/index.html?tag=result;title;2&lt;/a&gt;\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nInStRuCtIoNs:\n\nExtract the archive with latest Winrar or 7zip.\nMount or burn the SouthPark.img \nCopy &quot;crack.com&quot; and &quot;risc.dat&quot; into the installation folder and run crack.com\n[Read &quot;README&quot; in crack folder.]\n\nPlay! \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nImPoRtAnT NoTe:\n\nI couldnt get this working on Vista and it is untested on Xp.\n\nI have included a, should be working no cd crack. \nOther than that your on your own.\nIf you succeed in getting this to work please report back and leave a comment!!\n\n\nPLEASE SEED THIS RARE GAME WHEN YOU FINISH THE DOWNLOAD.\n\nEnjoy!!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d68728a9b3058ab2ce040b714064637f05d7624c","amp;dn":"South+Park++-+The+Video+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d68728a9b3058ab2ce040b714064637f05d7624c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,135,40,169,179,5,138,178,206,4,11,113,64,100,99,127,5,215,98,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
