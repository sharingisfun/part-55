I found NTSC and DVD9 version. It was so close that I could put this to DVD5 without compression but no way. Now there is absolutely nothing unnessecary. If I had removed some subtitles I would get reduction level level 99 %, but I think that people like to have own subtitles.\nI even removed all VTS that you dont need and programmed menu commands one by one. Menus takes now only 2.68 MB and audio 346 MB and rest is for picture. \nI was doing some other things some time and it&amp;#039;s nice to be back. I hope you like this one.\nThere is a Sample\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b3242974d46a7323c6c6175462103730690c995","amp;dn":"Twelve.Monkeys.1995.Multisubs.Pal.DVDR+-v666","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b3242974d46a7323c6c6175462103730690c995","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,50,66,151,77,70,167,50,60,108,97,117,70,33,3,115,6,144,201,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
