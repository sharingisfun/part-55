You can change this yourself if you want in /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist. I included BBEdit with the applications, it can edit the file in place with correct permissions.\n\n\nDuring the DVD bootup if your stuck at &quot;waiting for root device&quot; I am sorry your hardware is probably not supported. You can try changing some options in your BIOS, maybe you get lucky.\n\n\nIf you get error com.apple.boot.plist make sure to change AHCI in the BIOS, alternately your burn could be bad. Try again at a lower speed or with a different program.\n\n\nIf you have an AMD system please check the box for AMD-System-Fix to aplly the patches needed for Leopard to work!!\n\n\nAHCI works, but you are limited to two drives, turn this off if you have more than 2 drives you need to access.\n\n\nVideo Driver support has been updated. Improved NVidia, ATI and GMA950 graphics support with updated kexts. There are some new options here so take a look. For ATI I added new installers for 2600PRO/2600XT/3850/3870/3870X2. Now GMA950 has an option that will install Vanilla 10.5.2 kexts and Natit\n\n\nThe EFI bootloader automatically detects and installs for MBR/GUID thanks to Dense, it may have specific problems for Bad-Axe 2 systems, though so far there have been no reports of this.\n\n\nPlease select your IDE/SATA chipset during install.(One and only one!)\nAdded support for some Marvell PATA chipsets, for those ICH9 users that requested it. Choose the ICHx fixed IOATAFamily.kext.\n\n\nDefault selection for kernel is Netkas improved 9.2.0. If you select a Vanilla kernel please uncheck Netkas kernel.\n\n\nIf during the inital account creation your system locks up, try disabling your Network card. You can also visit osx86leo4all.wikidot.com for other directions.\n\n\nIf you installed Video drivers during install and your system freezes before the desktop loads,boot into single user mode with the bootflag -s at the Darwin prompt. Type:\n/sbin/fsck -fy\n/sbin/mount -uw /\n./RemoveVideo\nFollow the prompt to choose type of card.\nThen type exit to continue booting. \n\n\nIf after you boot to the desktop you get an error about an Extension not being properly installed open the Application I included called Extensions-Repair to correct this automatically.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                               Updates Include\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nFixed the Keyboard Language preferences. \n\n\nFixed AsianLanguagesSupport(I hope!)\n\n\nFixed &quot;About this Mac&quot; crashing Finder on some AMD machines. Again leave feedback if it is still crashes for you.\n\n\nImproved Nvidia graphics support with updated kexts. Even my 8800 GTS 512 works with these. Still try at your own risk.\n\n\nIf you choose no video driver options all video kext&amp;#039;s are removed except ATINDRV.kext, this one is used by Software Updates to verify the Leopard Graphics update is applied. You will have to manually remove this one if needed.\n\n\nCorrected an issue with some PS2 keyboards on laptops not working(I hope)\n\n\nAdded the latest Time Machine and Security Updates into the installer.\n\n\nAdded Quicktime 7.4.1 update.\n\n\nAdded option to choose Vanilla 9.2.2 kernel.(Intel SSE3 only!)\n\n\nUpdated AppleSMBIOS to latest version by Netkas.\n\n\nRemoved APIC option(Now the installer uses this older ACPIPlatform and AppleAPIC by default, unless you choose a Vanilla kernel)\n\n\nAdded new Applications: Unison, Pacifist, KextHelper\n\n\nAdded support for some Marvell PATA chipsets, for those ICH9 users that requested it. Choose the ICHx fixed IOATAFamily.kext\n\n\nSystem Profiler should be working as intended now for everyone.\n\n\nBy request I changed out the AppleIntegratedFramebuffer.kext\n\n\nModified the default ACL package, this may speed the install a little for some. It is down to under 15 minutes total for me!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a53437373a44c4a49e8b5b61b51a8683bce90f8","amp;dn":"Leo4Allv2+Universal+10.5.2+AMD%2FINTEL%5BSSE2%2FSSE3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a53437373a44c4a49e8b5b61b51a8683bce90f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,83,67,115,115,164,76,74,73,232,181,182,27,81,168,104,59,206,144,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
