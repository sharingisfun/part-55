Ron Paul&amp;#039;s name will be on all the remaining state ballots. Ron Paul volunteers are encouraged to become precinct captains, delegates to state and national conventions, and to try pass Constitutional proposals to each state&amp;#039;s Republican platform.\n\nFor example, volunteers in each state should try to attach amendments such as the following: Republicans believe that war should only be fought after a proper Declaration of War by Congress. Another possible platform idea is that: Republican Congressmen are expected to vote against any federal budget, Republican or Democrat, that is not balanced.\n\nWant to have some fun? Just imagine the fun when the debate begins on these ideas.\n\nIs Ron Paul still campaigning for president? Yes. Ron Paul has tentative plans to campaign in Pennsylvania and Kentucky. Ron Paul will also likely appear in other states that have remaining primaries.\n\nThe press is reporting that Ron Paul has quit the race. This is not true. Ron Paul&amp;#039;s video simply acknowledges that the campaign will continue but will also transform into additional activities such as education and supporting other candidates. In Kentucky we just held precinct conventions and Ron Paul Republicans won hundreds of precinct captains. In Kyle, Texas, Craig Young upset the establishment choice for Republican County Chairman.\n\nThe Ron Paul Revolution lives on! Victory comes in many forms. Help shape what the Ron Paul revolution becomes.\n\nSee also my interview on WBKO&amp;#039;s website: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.wbko.com/news/headlines/16437101.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.wbko.com/news/headlines/16437101.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dailypaul.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dailypaul.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.house.gov/paul/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.house.gov/paul/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ronpaul2008.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ronpaul2008.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c464221e67917f1468bdb63cbe33870ef075f94","amp;dn":"Ron+Paul+on+Alex+Jones+Show+-+March+14%2C+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c464221e67917f1468bdb63cbe33870ef075f94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,70,66,33,230,121,23,241,70,139,219,99,203,227,56,112,239,7,95,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
