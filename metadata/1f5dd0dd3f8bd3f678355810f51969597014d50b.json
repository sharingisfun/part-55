Type &quot;WAR&quot; to start\n7)Type WAR.EXE and enjoy the game\n\nYou wont have to this again after you have done it the once\n\nHope this works for you if not just comment\n\nEnjoy\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f5dd0dd3f8bd3f678355810f51969597014d50b","amp;dn":"Warcraft+Orcs+And+Humans+%28Tiny+Size%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f5dd0dd3f8bd3f678355810f51969597014d50b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,93,208,221,63,139,211,246,120,53,88,16,245,25,105,89,112,20,213,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
