Charting an intriguing fusion of industrial techno with the free-form organic passages that would become the norm in ambient techno several years later, Tales of Ephidrena was the first hint of what was to become the trademark sound of FSOL.\n\n\n\n\n\nCD Pressings Information\n\n\n\nLabel: Harvest\nCatalog#: ALICE001\nFormat: CD, Album, Promo, Copy Protected, Cardboard Sleeve\nCountry: UK\nReleased: Aug 2005\nGenre: Electronic, Rock\nStyle: Psychedelic Rock, Abstract, Downtempo, Prog Rock, Ambient\n\n\n\nCredits\n\n\nArtwork By - Amorphic Arts\nArtwork By [Collage / Digital Manipulation] - Gaz Cobain\nArtwork By [Layout] - Andrew Day\nEngineer - One Man Band Of Cosmos , Stone Freshwaters\nEngineer [Additional Recordings] - Mikey Rowe* (tracks: 1, 2, 4 to 6, 8, 9, 11, 13)\nEngineer [Additional] - His Motherness , Yage (tracks: 2, 4, 5, 11, 13)\nOther [Mackie Hr626 Monitors Supplied By] - Martin Warr\nOther [Product Managed By] - Paula Flack\nPhotography [Band Shot] - Bin Dog\nPhotography, Artwork By [Montage Assistance] - Dianne Harris\nProducer - Future Sound Of London, The\nWritten By - Brian Dougans , Garry Cobain , Mike Rowe (tracks: 4, 5) , Stuart Rowe (tracks: 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlice In Ultraland album review from Discogs.com\n\n\n\nReview by xenlab,\n\n\n\nBest album I&amp;#039;ve heard in a long long time.\n\nI knew it was going to be good as soon as the first piano chord struck.... but by the time the vocals come in on the 2nd track &amp;#039;The Witchfinder&amp;#039; you are so engulfed in the psychedelic ambience that the funky chorus almost blind sides you... and it only gets better from there.\n\nThis one is going to be in my rotation for a long time. Probably the most brilliant thing Brian Dougans &amp; Garry Cobain have ever done, IMHO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack List\n\n\n\n\n\nAmorphous Androgynous (FSOL) - Alice in Ultraland (2005)\n\n\n01.
