Winters), is a Canadian-born singer, actress, and model. She was the lead singer for the Prince-mentored female trio Vanity 6, which recorded the 1982 R&amp;B hit &quot;Nasty Girl&quot;.\n\nIn 1982, she met Prince, who re-named her Vanity, stating he saw his female reflection when he looked at her. Other versions of the story suggest that Prince coined the name Vagina initially, but she refused and renamed herself &quot;Vanity&quot; instead. Later that same year, she became the lead singer of the group Vanity 6. Their trademark was explicit sexuality in their lyrics, performances, and attire (extending even to the group&amp;#039;s name, with 6 alluding to the number of breasts in the group). The group&amp;#039;s biggest hit, &quot;Nasty Girl&quot;, reached #1 on Hot Dance Club Play and was produced by Prince. As Vanity, she dated Prince, Adam Ant, Micki Free, and Billy Idol during the 1980s. \n\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14e07982e55bef43a5ed4f494b852b93ab2d0ba7","amp;dn":"Vanity+-+Under+The+Influence","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14e07982e55bef43a5ed4f494b852b93ab2d0ba7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,224,121,130,229,91,239,67,165,237,79,73,75,133,43,147,171,45,11,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
