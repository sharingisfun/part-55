The movie follows the life of the fictional Jonas Cord from the mid 1920&amp;#039;s until the 1950&amp;#039;s. Cords&amp;#039; life closely follows the real life of  Howard Hughes. This movie was a first class production in its day. The video quality is fair. I have re-burnt and played it on a DVD player.
