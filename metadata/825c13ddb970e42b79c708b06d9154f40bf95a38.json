Been looking for it for about 5 years.  Happy to make it available on TPB.\n\nA very interesting story that spans continents. Tyrone Powers does his usual great acting in a period piece.  The main difficulty in the story is that the female lead, in both voice and appearance, appears to be in her early teens.  Her age is not specified in the story and may have just been one of the unspoken elements of the story given that it was filmed in the late 40s, early 50s of censorship.\n\nOh well, no big deal, but I did have to concentrate to get past her baby voice.  Watching early Orson Wells is always a treat.  Many reasons to add this to your collection.\n\nIMDB:\nIn the time of the crusades, a Saxon youth is forced to run away from England. He goes with his loyal retainer who brings along a British long bow. The two go all the way to China where they become involved in intrigues in the court of Kubla Kahn.
