Just PM me for any issues.\r\n\r\nDredd (2012) 720p BRRip x264 AAC AVALUNCH\r\n\r\nimage\r\n\r\nSOURCE: Dredd (2012) 1080p x264 DTS ...rent HD - Encoded by Pioneer\r\n\r\nSUBTITLES ARE SOFTCODED, NOT HARDCODED! They ended up at the screenshot since I used MPC-HC and they were on by default.\r\n\r\nI chose to encode this at 720p since there isn't any copy technically available here on KAT (although YTS does have on their site, but size-to-quality-wise a part of me wanted a slightly bigger size, so here I go...\r\n\r\nGRAINY FILM: The film itself seems to deliberately be relatively grainy throughout, which is technically more difficult to compress within such sizes like what I have in this torrent (969MB). I'm sorry for some parts that might be washed out; I'm not really a true dedicated encoder, I did this film more on for personal viewing, while doing some tiny improvements over the audio and video itself compared to some standard scene releasers that release within the sizes around or below 1GB for 720p. (If you're curious, I set the hue to 1.01 and -tune film in ffmpeg, as well as a very, very light hqdn3d denoise [0.4:0.4:1.8:1.8]; the denoise if very small to reduce the video file size just a bit, and since I'm technically 'overcompressing' the video itself when it comes to 720p standards, then the grain will get washed away anyway so... dunno if there's a perceivable difference compared to no usage but it looks fine to me.)\r\n\r\nNOTE: DTS audio track was first converted to WAV64 with eac3to and Arcsoft decoder (thanks Ofekmeister!) for optimal quality of decode (since supposedly, while ffmpeg does good at decoding with libdca, it is only able to decode the core, not the entire track itself).\r\n\r\nThen the 5.1 WAV64 result was downmixed with ffmpeg to stereo with pan and increase on the value of the 'front center' channel (this is where usually dialogue sound comes from, which means that at least in theory increasing the front center channel value a bit will make dialogue more hearable and make the movie sound more even with the background music and explosions and stuff).\r\n\r\nThen this downmix was further compressed with Audacity with RMS and settings similar to what Flicksick mentions on the Encoding thread (making it louder and for the overall movie to technically sound OK enough without the constant up-and-down volume switches due to loud explosions and background music and silent or soft dialogue coming out after or before).\r\n\r\nBy no means are my downmixes perfect, but at least personally to me they're at least good enough with my stereo speakers, without me needing to constantly turn the volume up and down compared to most scene releases that are in stereo (like YIFY, Ozlem, etc.) which seem to demand the need for more 'even' compressed audio due to fluctuating high-low volume sounds.\r\n\r\nSo anyway here it is!
