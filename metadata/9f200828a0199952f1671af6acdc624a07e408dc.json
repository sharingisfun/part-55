The result is a must-have for anybody researching Scientology seriously, and anybody who wants to have solid references to document many aspects of all things related Scientology.\n\nThis was sent to me on a DVD, had to cancel my first torrent after I realized there was a lot of duplicated materials in there. Now it's fine.\n\nAlso, versioning will allow to keep adding to the archive.\n\nMessage from the Compiler (keep in mind times have changed since then):\n\n&quot;This CD collection is humbly tendered as a gift to Mankind... for research purposes into the Church of Scientology. It is given freely, but I would ask some things in return:\n\n&quot;* The Compiler wishes to remain anonymous. Forget who sent this to you and destroy the envelope it came in.\n\n[...]\n\n&quot;* Do not speak about this collection publicly.\n\n&quot;The Compiler&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f200828a0199952f1671af6acdc624a07e408dc","amp;dn":"scientology-thecompiler-v20080313.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f200828a0199952f1671af6acdc624a07e408dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,32,8,40,160,25,153,82,241,103,26,246,172,220,98,74,7,228,8,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
