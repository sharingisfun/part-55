The quartets unique blend of passion and power proved to be a thrilling combination, and the summer set a new benchmark for Cure live highs.\n\nFestival 2005 presents a selection of these performances captured by a mix of fans, crew and &amp;#039;on-the-night-big-screen cameras&amp;#039;.\n\nEdited by Daren Butler and mixed by Keith Uddin in collaboration with Robert Smith, this 30 song DVD is a wonderful reminder of how and why The Cure remain one of the most vibrant bands on the planet.
