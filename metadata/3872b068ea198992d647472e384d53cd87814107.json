At a young age his musical talent started by picking up the trumpet in which he was first chair and honor band for the next 8 years.  With heavy metal taking storm in the 80&amp;#039;s his interest switched to electric guitar and base.  When he was 21 he walked into a concert that would forever change his musical career: the Sasha and Digweed Northern Exposure Expeditions tour. The quality of not only the music, but the talent behind the decks were astonishing.  The progressive house scene has taken off since then and so has DJ Maxim.  Playing in Denver clubs Bash, Sanctuary, and multiple raves, he looks to expand his horizons and his talent.   Maxim&amp;#039;s sessions take the listener on a journey, smoothly blending progressive tracks that grasp the soul and beg the feet to dance.\n\n\nInfluences:  Sasha, Digweed, DJ Taylor, Jimmy Van M, Carl Cox, Marco V, Mauro Picotto, Sander Kleinenberg, DJ Micro\n\n\nFuture Releases:  All CD&amp;#039;s are available on the website for download free of charge.
