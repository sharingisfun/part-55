The statistics alone are breathtaking: one in seven Iraqis has left their home; four million have fled the country; between 150,000 and one million have been killed. \n\nBut Omaar seeks out the human stories behind such figures, mostly via people he previously knew or worked with. &quot;Life has been destroyed,&quot; says one photographer colleague flatly; while a former office manager bemoans that, &quot;You can never tell who is the police and who is the gangster.&quot; \n\nAnd a women&amp;#039;s campaigner paints a sickening picture of poverty and prostitution. What emerges chillingly is how what was once a liberal, literate country has suffered a net loss of freedom and security. One war has become many as Sunni insurgents and Shia militias fight local power struggles, with no end in sight.\n\nXviD\n\n402 MB \n00:45:55\n\n\nretrack-shunster\nthebox.bz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6787fbcbca35769910748ac02bfdc6e79d39e56d","amp;dn":"The+Iraq+War+by+Numbers-+Rageh+Omaar+2008+03+17+%28ITV%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6787fbcbca35769910748ac02bfdc6e79d39e56d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,135,251,203,202,53,118,153,16,116,138,192,43,253,198,231,157,57,229,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
