Some very dry sounds have effects added, and some instrument&amp;#039;s volume is adjusted slightly in places. Other than this, the overall intention was to preserve the sound of the original mix where it works well. Dynamics are only touched when stuck out in a non musical sense.\nSubsonic filtering was applied very faithful and without phase errors, thus while DC offset and real subsonic is gone, there are enough low frequencies left to make cassette recording futile in the case of Chainsong 2004, unless you are using Dolby C or better. I felt those frequencies important to really able feel the rythm in places.\nAs a supporter of www.turnmeup.org, I choosed the overall level at -14 dBFS RMS sine, which is a few dB bellow many recent CD&amp;#039;s.\n\nThe Chainsong 2006 is encoded with HDCD compatible peak extensions. My own development allows to use them while being able to stay to up-to-date noise shaping technics, which original HDCD hardware didn&amp;#039;t have at all.\nThis is still in a beta stage, so if you have HDCD capable DAC&amp;#039;s, any feedback how well it works, or if it doesn&amp;#039;t work at all, is highly appreciated.\n\nMadtracker was made by Yannick.

People inspiring\n  eachother to reach new heights.\n\n  Teamwork is at the heart of this communitys success.\n\n  As we listen to tracks like this, and the sound effects\n  have entered our minds, hearts and souls, we are \n  learning - that when we put our minds to it, we can\n  accomplish MORE, with LESS.\n\n  I believe, that in order to succeed in todays world, we\n  need more than ever to come together, to work together.\n\n  To learn the skills we need and then, to teach our\n  fellow trackers, and then join together as a team, in\n  order to create that special song that people will remember.\n\n  We can be our own leaders. We can rise to meet these\n  challenges and pull out our greatest resources,\n  our minds, our energy, and our hearts \n  and make something even more extraordinary than\n  this song - if we stand by eachother.\n\n  This ending is dedicated to YOU my fellow tracker,\n  for helping the rest of us building something truly great -\n  the chainsong of 2006.\n\n  May you always be on the right track.\n  \nRaps by cHiEfRoCkA 4 ReaL\nSpeach by SoulEye\n\nThe Chainsong 2006 was organized by Factor and PyroZane.
