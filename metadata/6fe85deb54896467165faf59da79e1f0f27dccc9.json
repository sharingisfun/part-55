Staggering in the middle of the road from the beating by the thiefs, he is then struck by a car driving by a woman named Oom. Feeling sorry for him, Oom brings the man to her apartment and gives him shelter. The man, it turns out, has developed amnesia. Based the name on a pendant the man is wearing ? his only possession ? Oom names him Tan. A doctor&amp;#039;s examination reveals that Tan is uninjured except that he can&amp;#039;t remember anything about his life prior to being struck by Oom&amp;#039;s car. Tan is given a journal and urged to free associate in an effort to recall his past life.\nOom is experiencing trouble in her own life. She has recently broken up with her domineering boyfriend, Krit, whom she still sees at her workplace, where she is a creative director for an advertising agency. Oom is also had motherhood thrust upon her, since she is caring for her nephew, the son of her dead sister.\nInitially, having Tan around adds stress to the situation, and when Tan reorganizes her stacks of magazines, and interferes in her disciplining of Ohm, she is angry.\nBut Tan proves useful around the apartment. He is looked up to as a father figure by Ohm. And for Oom, he builds up the self esteem and confidence she lost in her relationship with Krit. Tan seems to instinctively know things about feminimity, such as what dress Oom should wear and what shade of lipstick is appropriate. As a family unit with Oom and Ohm, Tan goes to an amusement park and defends Oom after he gets in trouble for fighting in school, with the result being Tan getting punched by the other boy&amp;#039;s father...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fe85deb54896467165faf59da79e1f0f27dccc9","amp;dn":"%5BTHai+Movie%5D+-+Me...Myself+-+2007+%2Fengl.subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fe85deb54896467165faf59da79e1f0f27dccc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,232,93,235,84,137,100,103,22,95,175,89,218,121,225,240,242,125,204,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
