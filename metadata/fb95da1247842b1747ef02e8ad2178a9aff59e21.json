This is not free... It costs a big and nice THANKS!\nWell, not really, but it is appreciated. (Also, remember to SEED!)\n\nTested on: Windows Vista. \n\n--\nWhat is this?: This is a DOS emulator to play all DOS games optimally. However, DOSBox is a console-program, which means that it has no GUI. Many have developed custom GUIs for DOSBox - one of them is Erikgg with the GUI: D.O.G, which I&amp;#039;ve chosen, as I think it has all the advanced functions there are needed to play the games. You can choose  fullscreen in this GUI in the settings. Try play around with it a little. \n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Extract the .rar file. It works out of the box. \n2. To run DOSbox, run: &quot;DOG.exe&quot;. It has an already made profile, so you wont need to configure it. \n3. The already made profile is configured to run the VREALQRELEASE of Warcraft II from C: . \n4. If you want to run another DOS game, or run Warcraft II from another path, edit the profile and choose the filepath in that window - also, you can choose to play in &quot;fullscreen&quot; in the options.\n5. Enjoy! \n\n- Shraring is Caring!\n\n- &quot;The fool thinks he has won a battle when he bullies with harsh speech,\nbut knowing how to be forbearing alone makes one victorious.&quot;\nSamyutta Nikaya I, 163\n\n- &quot;Sometimes your joy is the source of your smile, \nbut sometimes your smile can be the source of your joy.&quot; - Thich Nhat Hanh.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb95da1247842b1747ef02e8ad2178a9aff59e21","amp;dn":"DOSbox.GUI.Modified.and.ready2use.VREALQRELEASE.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb95da1247842b1747ef02e8ad2178a9aff59e21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,149,218,18,71,132,43,23,71,239,2,232,173,33,120,169,175,245,158,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
