Unfortunately, I was only able to rip the photos from the flash website without any additional information (like who the photographer is or a description of the photo). \n\nI&amp;#039;ve used the firebug plugin for firefox and winhttrack to obtain all pictures, although I had to browse all the thumbnails to obtain weblinks for the pictures, which took about half a day.\n\nFor conditions and terms to use these pictures, I refer to the Canon website:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ta.canon-europe.com/index.php?pg=gallery&amp;cc=gb&amp;lc=en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ta.canon-europe.com/index.php?pg=gallery&amp;cc=gb&amp;lc=en&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor info about a specific photo, where the name of the picture is xxx.jpg,\nyou can view the webpage: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ta.canon-europe.com/?pg=gallery&amp;cc=gb&amp;lc=en&amp;photo_id=xxx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ta.canon-europe.com/?pg=gallery&amp;cc=gb&amp;lc=en&amp;photo_id=xxx&lt;/a&gt;\n\n(So you have to substitute the filename without the extension of the picture for &amp;#039;xxx&amp;#039;.)\n\nIf you have the photos on your computer, you can view them more conveniently in a slideshow to form a better judgement of the pictures that stand out from the rest and deserve a vote. You need to register for voting and you can vote on multiple pictures.\n\nI&amp;#039;ve created rar files for each of the 18 countries participating in the competition. The rar files do not have an associated password and can be extracted with winrar 3.50 or newer.\n\nPictures are divided in 4 categories: Landscape, Macro, Portrait and Sports.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5700e7a5c291a9256be6702337d353366b24573","amp;dn":"the+canon+challenge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5700e7a5c291a9256be6702337d353366b24573","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,112,14,122,92,41,26,146,86,190,103,2,51,125,53,51,102,178,69,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
