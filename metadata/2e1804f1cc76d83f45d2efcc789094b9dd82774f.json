But one of the cases is far from small-time - the appeal to overturn the murder conviction of National Guard reservist Evan Scholler, who has been sentenced to life without parole for the murder of an ex-Navy SEAL and private contractor named Ron Nolan. Two rapid-fire events in Iraq conspired to bring the men into fatal conflict: Nolan&amp;#039;s relationship with Evan&amp;#039;s girlfriend, Tara, a beautiful schoolteacher back home in the states, followed by a deadly incident in which Nolan&amp;#039;s apparent mistake results in the death of an innocent Iraqi family as well as seven men in Evan&amp;#039;s platoon. As the murky relationship between the U.S. government and its private contractors plays out in the personal drama of these two men, and the consequences for Evan become a desperate matter of life and death, Dismas Hardy begins to uncover a terrible and perilous truth that takes him far beyond the case and into the realm of assassination and treason.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e1804f1cc76d83f45d2efcc789094b9dd82774f","amp;dn":"John+Lescroart+-+Betrayal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e1804f1cc76d83f45d2efcc789094b9dd82774f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,24,4,241,204,118,216,63,69,210,239,204,120,144,148,185,221,130,119,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
