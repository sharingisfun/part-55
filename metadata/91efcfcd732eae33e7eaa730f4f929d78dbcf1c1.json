Mood extremes can lead to psychosis, hallucinations and delusional thinking. For the past 30 years, we&amp;#039;ve assumed that medications can fix mood disorders. Scholar and broadcaster Monique Dull takes us on a fascinating journey and shows us that taking the right medications brings things totally back to normal for only  1 in 4 patients with manic-depressive illness. Mood hygiene captures the new tension in clinical thinking. The new theory for controlling mood is based on the idea of controlling behaviour to keep the illness at bay.\n\nOriginally broadcast on CBC Radio&amp;#039;s Ideas program.\n53 minutes. 64kbs 44kHz mono Ogg Vorbis","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91efcfcd732eae33e7eaa730f4f929d78dbcf1c1","amp;dn":"Mood+Management+-+Radio+documentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91efcfcd732eae33e7eaa730f4f929d78dbcf1c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,239,207,205,115,46,174,51,231,234,167,48,244,249,41,215,141,188,241,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
