Funky is a direction that Benoit is clearly ready for. You hear it especially on &quot;ReJoyce,&quot; a celebration of the groove with Benoit using a Hammond B-3 organ for some deep soul. &quot;Miles After Dark&quot; also stands out, with Braun adding some tasty muted trumpet to the midnight mood. Benoit&amp;#039;s style is still in evidence, though, especially on the slow tunes and the characteristic classical touches and Latin beats. &quot;Dad&amp;#039;s Room&quot; is a beautiful ballad, with rays of light breaking into the slightly somber mood. It shows just what a master of shading Benoit is. --Adam Rains \n\npersonnel:\nDavid Benoit  Piano\nVinnie Colaiuta  Drums\nDave Palmer  Drums\nRoss Bolton  Guitar\nRick Braun  Programming, Trumpet\nPat Kelley  Guitar\nCliff Hugo  Bass\nMarc Antoine  Guitar\nJimmy Johnson  Bass\nJohn Ferraro  Percussion, Cymbals\nTony Maiden  Guitar\nNeil Stubenhaus  Bass\nBrad Dutz  Percussion\nAndy Suzuki  Tenor Saxophone\n\nTrack Listing:\n1.Why Not!\n2.
