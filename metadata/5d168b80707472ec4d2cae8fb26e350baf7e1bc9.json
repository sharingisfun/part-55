The band was one of the few groups to emerge from the early 1980s New York no wave scene and stay intact into the next decade. Formed by Gira in 1982, Swans employed a shifting lineup of musicians until their dissolution in 1997. Besides Gira, the only other constant members were keyboardist/vocalist/songwriter Jarboe from 1984 to 1997, and semi-constant guitarist Norman Westberg. The band became known for its experimental instrumentation and repetitive song structures. In 2010, Gira reformed Swans without Jarboe.\r\n\r\nStudio albums\r\n\r\n    Filth (1983)\r\n    Cop (1984)\r\n    Greed (1986)\r\n    Holy Money (1986)\r\n    Children of God (1987)\r\n    The Burning World (1989)\r\n    White Light from the Mouth of Infinity (1991)\r\n    Love of Life (1992)\r\n    The Great Annihilator (1995)\r\n    Soundtracks for the Blind (1996)\r\n    My Father Will Guide Me up a Rope to the Sky (2010)\r\n    The Seer (2012)\r\n    To Be Kind (2014)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d168b80707472ec4d2cae8fb26e350baf7e1bc9","amp;dn":"Swans","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d168b80707472ec4d2cae8fb26e350baf7e1bc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,22,139,128,112,116,114,236,77,44,174,143,178,110,53,11,175,126,27,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
