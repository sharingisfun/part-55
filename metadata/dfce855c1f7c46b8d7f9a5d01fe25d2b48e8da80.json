Rinpoche trained in the traditional monastic system for over twenty-five years, and in 1995 graduated with the highest degree of Geshe Lharampa from Sera Je Monastery in South India. He then completed his studies at Gyume Tantric College, and, in 1998, having the particular wish to benefit Western students of the Buddhadharma, Rinpoche came to the West to teach and travel extensively throughout America and Europe.\n\nRinpoche was a resident teacher at Deer Park Buddhist Center in Madison, Wisconsin for five years, and is currently the Spiritual Director of Ganden Shedrup Ling Buddhist Center in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where the students recently completed the first phase of a two-year study and practice program based on the traditional Tibetan curriculum but designed and tailored for modern students of the Buddhadharma. Rinpoche is the author of Practicing the Path: A Commentary on the Lamrim Chenmo, published in 2003 by Wisdom Publications. Rinpoche teaches in English, and is admired wherever he travels for his unique presentation of the Dharma, his interest in and enthusiasm for Western culture, and his evident embodiment of the wisdom and compassion of the Buddhist path.\n\nThese recordings were made at Dharma Friends Foundation (DFF) in Seattle, WA USA on February 11, 2007.\n\nThe list of tracks are:\n\n\nYangsi Rinpoche_Buddha_Nature_20070211_am - .mp3\nYangsi Rinpoche_Buddha_Nature_20070211_pm - .mp3\nYangsi Rinpoche_ThreeTrainings_20070304am - .mp3\n\n               3 File(s)     94,713,064 bytes\n\nAccumulate merit - keep sharing!\n\nFor more Buddhist Dharma torrents check out: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thepiratebay.se/user/karmapa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thepiratebay.se/user/karmapa&lt;/a&gt; \n\nMetta!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfce855c1f7c46b8d7f9a5d01fe25d2b48e8da80","amp;dn":"Buddhist+Dharma+Yangsi+Rinpoche+on+Buddha+Nature+-+3+Trainings","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfce855c1f7c46b8d7f9a5d01fe25d2b48e8da80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,206,133,92,31,124,70,184,215,249,165,208,31,226,93,43,72,232,218,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
