The ingredients are simple, but thanks to a good sense of melody and arrangement the whole thing becomes really tasty after all.\r\nAfter having finished a (now forgotten) film soundtrack and their musically independent and critically acclaimed debut album, the first line-up of Supertramp disbanded. The only further relic composed in those days was the mediocre song Gold Rush which ended up on the Slow Motion record. With a new drummer, an additional wind player, a new bass guitarist and Roger Hodgson switching from bass guitar to regular guitar the band conceived their second album in 1971. In 1972 this line-up also composed and debuted some of the classic songs of Crime of the Century and Crisis? What Crisis? for the BBC, such as School and If Everyone Was Listening.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you get this album don't hope for the operatic and sound-effect-laden sound of Crime of the Century. Some reviewers argue that songs like Aries or Travelled sound like progressive rock, but I don't think that's true. Indelibly Stamped is genuine art pop, mostly closer to R&amp;B than to folk or jazz, but this shall not keep you from buying it - many different genres are touched and sometimes mixed, but it all comes together in the British melancholia which shapes and defines the compositions. In spite of some fillers and odd moments Indelibly Stamped shall be highly recommended for open-minded prog listeners who also enjoy more 'immediate' music.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01.
