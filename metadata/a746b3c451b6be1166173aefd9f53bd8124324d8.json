With careers, reputations, and personal safety on the line, they spoke out against the administrationÃƒÂ¢??s misdeeds and cover-ups: Craig Murray, who leaked documents revealing horrific human rights abuses by coalition ally Uzbekistan; John Brady Kiesling and other ambassadors who resigned in the run-up to war; Bunnatine Greenhouse, who blew the lid off a massive government contracting scandal; military officials like General Eric Shinseki; and many others who demonstrated the courage of their convictions. From desk jockeys to high-ranking diplomats, these patriotic men and women share one common trait: a willingness to stand up and speak truth to power. By exposing policies and actions that run counter to the best interests of the nation and its people, they elucidate why dissent is crucial to a thriving democracy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a746b3c451b6be1166173aefd9f53bd8124324d8","amp;dn":"Dissent%3A+Voices+of+Conscience%3B+Gov+Insiders+Speak+Out+Against+Ir","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a746b3c451b6be1166173aefd9f53bd8124324d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,70,179,196,81,182,190,17,102,23,58,239,217,245,59,216,18,67,36,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
