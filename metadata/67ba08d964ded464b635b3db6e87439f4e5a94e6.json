With so much of Robert?s public work being taken up with ?scaping in recent times, it?s almost a novelty to hear him rocking it up like he does on Time Groove from Boston and Queer Jazz NYC.\n\nDespite all the technology involved this is a pared-back sound compared to previous projeKcts, and there&amp;#039;s a tentative, exploratory quality about much of the music; two players in search of that often elusive moment, an intriguing aspect which provides much of the tension and appeal.\n\nAs well as the big set pieces there are some little jewels to be found in small places; the Frippertronics-like ending of Berklee Strut and the beginning of End Time Boston. Of this gig the Boston Herald commented ?With Belew pounding on an electronic drum kit, Fripp tore into a set of improvised sound sketches, mixing in hints of electronic programming under his searing guitar explorations.?\n\nTo these ears the pick of the bunch though comes from the Keswick gigs which push some of the ideas and themes investigated in the P6 series a little further. As ever Fripp?s own commentary on the performance is more circumspect. ?An enjoyable performance. Probably, we played well, but I have no idea.?\n\n \nTracks\nDisc Number 1\n1.  \tThreshold Knock Knock Who&amp;#039;s There Boston\t  \t 0.28\n2.  \tTime Groove Boston\t   \t \t \t \t 6.23\n3.  \tQueer Jazz Boston\t   \t  \t \t \t 7.55\n4.  \tThreshold P6 Boston\t   \t  \t \t \t 1.35\n5.  \tBerklee Strut Boston\t   \t  \t \t \t 2.28\n6.  \tEnd Time Boston\t   \t  \t \t \t \t 4.46\n7.  \tThreshold Knock Knock Who&amp;#039;s There NYC\t   \t  \t 1.05\n8.  \tTime Groove NYC\t   \t  \t \t \t \t 7.54\n9.  \tMission Possible NYC\t   \t  \t \t \t 3.30\n10.  \tSpace Threshold NYC\t   \t  \t \t \t 0.56\n11.  \tQueer Jazz NYC\t   \t  \t \t \t \t 7.49\n12.  \tThreshold Knock Knock Who&amp;#039;s There Keswick\t   \t 1.25\n13.  \tPersian E Keswick\t   \t  \t \t \t 6.57\n14.  \tTime Groove Keswick\t   \t  \t \t \t 7.47\n\n\nPersonnel\nAdrian Belew - V-drumming\nRobert Fripp - Guitar","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67ba08d964ded464b635b3db6e87439f4e5a94e6","amp;dn":"ProjeKct+Six+-+East+coast+live+-+MP3+-+including+artwork","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67ba08d964ded464b635b3db6e87439f4e5a94e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,186,8,217,100,222,212,100,182,53,179,219,110,135,67,159,78,90,148,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
