The current Wolverine and Fantastic Four arcs are awesome and my favorite space book, Nova, came out. This is going to be a light week, not a lot is released this week. So here are the books that hit the store shelves Wednesday. Monday's torrent will be full of back issues.\n\nA few notes, Amazing Spider-Girl's cover has a misprint on it. The cover list the issue as issue 17 when in fact it's issue 19. And for those wondering, the Skrull face Variants releases are just the variant covers. The books were released in past packs. The Promo Card is just that, a little promo card for upcoming series they give out at you LCS.\n\nEnjoy these new books. See you Monday.\n\n\nAmazing Spider-Girl 019 (2008) (Minutemen-The Killers)\nAmazing Spider-Man 556 (2008) (Minutemen-ReZone)\nAvengers - Invaders (2008) (promo card) (Minutemen-RainsDesire)\nBionicle 009 (2002) (c2c) (Minutemen-Devil)\nCaptain Marvel 04 (of 05) (2008) (Skrull Face Incentive Variant) (Minutemen-RainsDesire)\nDead of Night 03 (of 04) (2008) (Minutemen-The Killers)\nDNA Hacker Chronicles 001 (2008) (Minutemen-Zone)\nDoktor Sleepless 006 (2008) (Minutemen-TheSaint)\nEcho 002 (2008) (Minutemen-Zone)\nEvil Dead 04 (of 04) (2008) (Minutemen-Army of Dead)\nFantastic Four 556 (2008) (Minutemen-ZonesDiva)\nGamekeeper v2 002 (2008) (Minutemen-Starsky &amp; Hutch)\nGeorge R.R.
