It&amp;#039;s sarcastic and true at the same time. Sarcastic when you look at the situation within the band and the Wilson family, which had little to do with harmony most of the time. True when you listen to the beautiful, timeless music the band made. There are so many funny, sad and genuinely messed up moments in the Beach Boys story, that it would take no less than a 5 DVD Box Set ÃƒÂ  la The Beatles&amp;#039; &quot;Anthology&quot; to tell the story properly. At normal feature length &quot;Endless Harmony&quot; leaves one longing for more in depth information about the creation of all the big hits, the Wilson&amp;#039;s family story or the conflict between the individual band members. The documentary touches all those topics and also features early video clips (most of them in their full length) and some pretty interesting alternative takes of familiar songs (for instance, a beautiful version of &quot;&amp;#039;Til I Die&quot;). Recommendable for fans of the Beach Boys and anybody who&amp;#039;s interested to learn about one of the most important bands in rock history.\n\nIncludes all menus and extra video footage. 141 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b1c4a2559f654110d2cdc1f806ba5e353dcdd59","amp;dn":"Endless+Harmony+The+Beach+Boys+Story+DVD+full+rip.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b1c4a2559f654110d2cdc1f806ba5e353dcdd59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,28,74,37,89,246,84,17,13,44,220,31,128,107,165,227,83,220,221,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
