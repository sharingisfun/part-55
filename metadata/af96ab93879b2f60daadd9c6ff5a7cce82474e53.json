Is it a chicken? Or is it something more than chicken? Perhaps it is that which makes human. Or more human than human. Yes, a Super Chicken.\n\n\nHere are episodes 1 and 2 of Heroes synced up with the Rifftrax audio. This is dedicated to Riverburn, Xannax, Frisky_Dingo, and other RT uploaders. I do this because I like the convenience of having a synced up file. If you enjoy this, I highly recommend donating (http://rifftrax.com/donate) or even buying and synchronizing your own Rifftrax. They are a small company and do need people to actually pay for stuff on occasion.\n\n\n\nExcelsior!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af96ab93879b2f60daadd9c6ff5a7cce82474e53","amp;dn":"Heroes+-+Rifftrax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af96ab93879b2f60daadd9c6ff5a7cce82474e53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,150,171,147,135,155,47,96,218,173,217,198,255,90,124,206,130,71,78,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
