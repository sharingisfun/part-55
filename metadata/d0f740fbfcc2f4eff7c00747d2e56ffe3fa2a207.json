What I did was seperate the 3 episodes of the finale (S04E12-14) and convert each one as a wmv file from the large MPEG file my computer recorded.  If you prefer to have them seperately, at about 500MB a piece retaining very good quality, this is a good choice.  I just rewatched the eps using these files on my 22 inch monitor and I was very pleased.\n\n\nThere&amp;#039;s No Place Like Home (1)   \nCommunity Score\n9.5 Superb \t47 reviews\n\nFirst aired: 5/15/2008    Production Code: 412\n\nSayid goes back to the island to bring the rest of the people to the freighter.
