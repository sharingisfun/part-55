First he needs musicians and singers: things slowly start to click when he finds three fine-voiced females virtually in his back yard, a lead singer (Deco) at a wedding, and, responding to his ad, an aging trumpet player, Joey &quot;The Lips&quot; Fagan. Song by song, gig by gig, the Commitments start their climb to the top: Dublin gets soul. But internal strife also builds: Deco is insufferable, Joey&amp;#039;s a Casanova, and Jimmy may lack the seasoning to hold things together. Will the Commitments slip away?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d6f65f1a6c5db7bdca8473c60b9eeeeee9fd6be","amp;dn":"the+commitments+dvd+%5BResource+RG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d6f65f1a6c5db7bdca8473c60b9eeeeee9fd6be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,111,101,241,166,197,219,123,220,168,71,60,96,185,238,238,238,159,214,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
