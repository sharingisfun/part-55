In 1997 they decided to change Entwine&amp;#039;s musical style to gothic metal and rhythm guitarist and vocalist Panu Willman was shortly after added to the band&amp;#039;s line-up. In December of that year, Entwine recorded its first demo, entitled Divine Infinity. In February of 1998 female singer and keyboard player Riitta Heikkonen joined the band.\n\nEntwine&amp;#039;s debut album Treasures Within Hearts was released it in September of 1999.\n\n\nTRACKLISTING\n\nQUOTE\n1.
