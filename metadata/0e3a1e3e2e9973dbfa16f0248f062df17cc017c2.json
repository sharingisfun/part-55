When he learns of oil-rich land in California that can be bought cheaply, he moves his operation there and begins manipulating and exploiting the local landowners into selling him their property. Using his young adopted son H.W. to project the image of a caring family man, Plainview gains the cooperation of almost all the locals with lofty promises to build schools and cultivate the land to make their community flourish. Over time, Plainview&amp;#039;s gradual accumulation of wealth and power causes his true self to surface, and he begins to slowly alienate himself from everyone in his life.\n\nDirector:        Paul Thomas Anderson\n\nCountry:         USA\n\nTransfer Format: 1080p \n\nYear:            2007\n\nRunning Time:    158 min\n\nIMDB:           &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469494/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469494/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFinalcodec Player \n\ndownload                                                                     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.siluhd.com/soft/FinalCodecs2008sp.exe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.siluhd.com/soft/FinalCodecs2008sp.exe&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou need a powerfull computer to play VC-1 codec HD\nRecommended: INTEL Core2 DUO or AMD X2 4800+ and ATI 2400 PRO\n\nOther movies visit                                                                          \n\n               &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/accpt7506_siluer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/accpt7506_siluer&lt;/a&gt;\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e3a1e3e2e9973dbfa16f0248f062df17cc017c2","amp;dn":"There.Will.Be.Blood.Blu-Ray.REMUX.1080p.VC1.TrueHD.DD5.1.%40SiluHD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e3a1e3e2e9973dbfa16f0248f062df17cc017c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,58,30,62,46,153,115,219,250,22,240,36,143,6,45,241,124,192,23,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
