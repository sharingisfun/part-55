Lansky was one of the mobsters that formed the &quot;syndicate&quot; U.S. Mafia. The movie takes him from childhood and small time street punk through the formation of the &quot;Syndicate&quot; with Bugsy Siegal and Charley &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano. The movie shows his decline in power and wealth beging with the Cuban revolution, and the loss of his holdings in Havana to his last legal problems with the U.S. government.
