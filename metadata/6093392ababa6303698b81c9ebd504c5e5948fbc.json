CARRIER follows a core group of film participants aboard the USS Nimitz, from the admiral of the strike group to the fighter pilots to the youngest sailors, as they navigate personal conflicts around their jobs, families, faith, patriotism, love, the rites of passage and the war on terror.\n\nExecutive Producer: Mel Gibson\n\nEpisode Seven: Rites of Passage\n\nThe last day in the Gulf is the last chance to drop bombs before the Nimitz heads home. The jets take off, laden with ordnance, and return hours later, still carrying the same bombs. In the middle of flight operations, a storm arises in the South Indian Ocean. The deck pitches violently, turning the already dangerous task of landing on the carrier into a nail-biting, heart-pounding drama.\n\nRelease Info:\nSource......: W4F and SoS HDTVRips\nLength......: 00:55:00\nVideo.......: XviD 1625kb/s 29.970fps 720x400\nAudio.......: 134kb/s MP3 48000Hz\n\nEnjoy!
