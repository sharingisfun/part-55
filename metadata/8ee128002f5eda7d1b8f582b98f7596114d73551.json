A Decca Records conference \nroom, three voices and 20 minutes were all that was required to land the \ngroup a recording deal. Now, nearly eight months later the vocal group, who \nworked with some of music s most prominent songwriters including Marcus \nHummon and J.D. Souther, is ready to release their debut album March 11th.\n\nRegardless of the time it took for One Flew South to land their recording and \npublishing contract, they are no overnight success. Rather, the three \nNashville based vocalist-songwriters have been involved in the music business \nfor years prior to hitting upon a perfect combination and bringing back to life \na band starring three superbly matched vocalists whose harmonies are \nunparalleled. One Flew South teamed up with Nashville songwriter Marcus \nHummon to produce their debut album. A Nashville-based songwriter whose \ncatalog contained six No. 1 hits from the likes of The Dixie Chicks, Tim \nMcGraw and Rascal Flatts Grammy-winning Bless the Broken Road, Marcus \nbought out the best in all three members of the group from singing to \nsongwriting. The guys also teamed up with legendary songwriter J.D. \nSouther, who co-wrote such Eagles classics as Best of My Love and \nHeartache Tonight, to write several of the tracks on the album. J.D. s \nnotable lyrical ability is prominent on the album and the result is nothing less \nthan an amazing album of trio harmonies and sound that the music industry \nhas not heard in quite some time.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ee128002f5eda7d1b8f582b98f7596114d73551","amp;dn":"One+Flew+South+-+Last+of+the+Good+Guys+%5B2008%2FVBR202%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ee128002f5eda7d1b8f582b98f7596114d73551","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,225,40,0,47,94,218,125,27,143,88,43,152,247,89,97,20,215,53,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
