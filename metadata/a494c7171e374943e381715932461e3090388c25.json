Sean O'Callaghan for the first time documents the history of these people: their transportation, the conditions in which they lived on plantations as slaves or servants, and their rebellions in Barbados.\r\n\r\n&quot;An illuminating insight into a neglected episode in Irish history, but its significance is much broader than that. Its main achievement is to situate the story of colonialism in Ireland in the much larger context of worldwide European imperialism. O'Callaghan's description of seventeenth century Barbados is a powerful portrait of a society as brutal, corrupt and unjust as anything the twentieth century has to offer. Yet it is precisely societies like colonial Barbados and Virginia which lie at the root of our modern world. That is why To Hell or Barbados is such a valuable book.&quot;--Irish World\r\n\r\n240 pages\r\nPublisher: Brandon Books (September 2000)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 0863222722\r\nISBN-13: 978-0863222726","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a494c7171e374943e381715932461e3090388c25","amp;dn":"To+Hell+or+Barbados+%282000%29+by+Sean+O%27Callaghan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a494c7171e374943e381715932461e3090388c25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,148,199,23,30,55,73,67,227,129,113,89,50,70,30,48,144,56,140,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
