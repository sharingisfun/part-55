This first comprehensive guide to all 68 spider families in North America beautifully illustrates 469 of the most commonly encountered species. Group keys enable identification by web type and other observable details, and species descriptions include identification tips, typical habitat, geographic distribution, and behavioral notes. A concise illustrated introduction to spider biology and anatomy explains spider relationships. This book is a critical resource for curious naturalists who want to understand this ubiquitous and ecologically critical component of our biosphere.\r\n\r\nThis book is so well hyperlinked it is frightening!\r\n\r\n\r\nazw3 can be converted in Calibre to whichever format you prefer, or can be directly placed in a Kindle file directory. Having been told I was uploading &quot;useless&quot; azw3 files, I hope you take the time to read this, learn about Calibre, or shut the fuck up. Cheers.
