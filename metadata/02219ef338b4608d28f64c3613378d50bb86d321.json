Herman Rarebell, the man behind the German bandÃƒÂ¢??s kit during their most ÃƒÂ¢??classicÃƒÂ¢?? period, releases his newest solo album and - while listening to the CD for the x-th time - he seems rather in good mood to deliver some plain hard rockinÃƒÂ¢?? ÃƒÂ¢??nÃƒÂ¢?? rollinÃƒÂ¢?? tunes that will surely not ÃƒÂ¢??driveÃƒÂ¢?? some either crazy or bored. On second thought, the term ÃƒÂ¢??anyway goodÃƒÂ¢?? stands in line with &quot;IÃƒÂ¢??m Back!&quot;. And, for those not aware of the fact, this is not HermanÃƒÂ¢??s first solo effort. We should travel back in time to supply more info.\n\nRarebellÃƒÂ¢??s first ÃƒÂ¢??properÃƒÂ¢?? solo album was released back in 1982; the mediocre &quot;Nip In The Bud&quot; was totally re-mixed (Micheal Wagener, be him) plus vocal parts were totally re-recorded to see an ÃƒÂ¢??updatedÃƒÂ¢?? release in 1986 in the &quot;Herman Ze German And Friends&quot; title. No grand sales wre scored, though...1993 sees Rarebell leaving SCORPIONS (after the &quot;Face The Heat&quot; album) while 1995ÃƒÂ¢??s &quot;In The Mood&quot; single was all of his post-SCORPIONS 90s deeds. Nealry a decade later, his new outfit R&amp;R toured in 2004, the gigs showing an expanded collage of art featuring paintings of ROLLING STONES guitarist Ronnie Wood and Ronald Muri (ÃƒÂ¢??Pop-Expressionist MovementÃƒÂ¢?? founder) plus onstage dancers. The touring band included ex-7 SINS saxophonist and well known actress Claudia Raab, a lady also featured in...\n\n...2007ÃƒÂ¢??s &quot;IÃƒÂ¢??m Back!&quot;, too. The album sees a tracklist of twelve hard rockinÃƒÂ¢?? tunes and the conclusion - after several auditions - is ÃƒÂ¢??stableÃƒÂ¢?? by far. &quot;IÃƒÂ¢??m Back!&quot; is an honest record, in terms of songwriting approach, but lacks spirit and fresnhness. There are four or five songs that can draw your interest, but the overall mood is quite flat. The ÃƒÂ¢??paleÃƒÂ¢?? production may also be a good reason for this. Singer Stefan Erz has an interesting voice; quite immature though. RarebellÃƒÂ¢??s playing is simple but thorough, while the rest of the players contribute nothing more (or less) than normal instrumentation. The tempo of &quot;DonÃƒÂ¢??t Lose Your Trust&quot;, the aura of &quot;Your Love Is Hurting&quot; (the ballad of the album) plus the vibe of &quot;Backattack&quot; may leave a more-than-good impression, while there are more than four tunes which could easily be absent from the CD.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02219ef338b4608d28f64c3613378d50bb86d321","amp;dn":"Herman+Rarebell+-+I%5C%27m+Back","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02219ef338b4608d28f64c3613378d50bb86d321","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,33,158,243,56,180,96,141,40,246,76,54,19,55,141,80,187,134,211,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
