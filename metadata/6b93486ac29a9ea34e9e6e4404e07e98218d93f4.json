Standard antivirus programs are good at detecting this Malware, but not always so good at effectively removing it. Trojan Remover is designed specifically to disable/remove Malware without the user having to manually edit system files or the Registry. The program also removes the additional system modifications some Malware carries out which are ignored by standard antivirus and trojan scanners. \n\nTrojan Remover scans ALL the files loaded at boot time for Adware, Spyware, Remote Access Trojans, Internet Worms and other malware. Trojan Remover also checks to see if Windows loads Services which are hidden by Rootkit techniques and warns you if it finds any. For each identified Trojan Horse, Worm, or other malware, Trojan Remover pops up an alert screen which shows the file location and name; it offers to remove the program&amp;#039;s reference from the system files and allows you to rename the file to stop its activation. \n\n \n\nMost modern Malware programs are memory-resident, which makes their de-activation more difficult. How many times have you been told to start your computer in &amp;#039;Safe&amp;#039; mode, or even worse, in DOS? Trojan Remover does all this for you. When it finds Malware that is memory-resident, Trojan Remover automatically re-starts (on request) your system and completely DISABLES the Malware before Windows restarts. \nTrojan Remover writes a detailed logfile every time it performs a scan. This logfile contains information on which programs load at boot-time, and what (if any) actions Trojan Remover carried out. The logfile can be viewed and printed using Notepad. \nTrojan Remover is set to automatically scan for Malware every time you start your PC (you can disable this automatic scan if you wish). \n\nTrojan Remover is designed to work on Windows 98/ME/2000/XP/Vista. The program is not, at present, compatible with any 64bit version of Windows. \n\nChanges in Version 6.7.0: \n* Added new scan routine: Autorun.inf files are now searched for and scanned. \n* Improved registry scan to include checks of Drivers32 entries (an obscure loading point used by some recent malware). \n* Improved detection and removal of Backdoor.Rustock variants. \n* Added new heuristic detection methods for the VirtuMonde/Vundo malware family. \nImproved detection routine for the Backdoor.Rustock family of malware drivers. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.simplysup.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.simplysup.com&lt;/a&gt; \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b93486ac29a9ea34e9e6e4404e07e98218d93f4","amp;dn":"Trojan+Remover+6.7.0+Build+2534","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b93486ac29a9ea34e9e6e4404e07e98218d93f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,147,72,106,194,154,158,163,78,158,110,68,4,224,126,152,33,141,147,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
