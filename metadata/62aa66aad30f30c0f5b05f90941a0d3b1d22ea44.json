The collective puts a weird spin on seductive soul with &amp;#039;Every Planet We Reach Is Dead&amp;#039;, while &amp;#039;White Light&amp;#039; starts off in similar territory as Blur&amp;#039;s raucous &amp;#039;Song 2&amp;#039; before being interrupted by an angelic interlude. For an extra dash of oddness, actor Dennis Hopper offers spoken-word intonations atop &amp;#039;Fire Coming Out of a Monkey&amp;#039;s Head&amp;#039;.\nThe London Community Gospel Choir can be heard on the title track while De La Soul make an appearance on the albums first single &amp;#039;Feel Good Inc&amp;#039;. There are also guest spots by Blondie&amp;#039;s Deborah Harry, rock legend Ike Turner, the Happy Mondays&amp;#039; Shaun Ryder and underground rapper MF Doom sprinkled throughout other cuts. The Gorillaz are back in town!\n\ntrack listing\n\n     1. Intro\n     2. Last Living Souls\n     3. Kids With Guns\n     4. O Green World\n     5. Dirty Harry\n     6. Feel Good Inc.\n     7.
