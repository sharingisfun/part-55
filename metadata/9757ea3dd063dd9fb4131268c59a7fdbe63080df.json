Shortened Barricade sitting next to air force oneÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦..waitingÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦..forÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦.? \n\nCut Maggie saying ÃƒÂ¢??there is nothing on earth that complex (obvious). \n\nCut Maggie saying ÃƒÂ¢??what about an organism?ÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦..dna based computer, and I-I-I-I-I know that sounds crazyÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢?? \n\nCut Sams dad saying ÃƒÂ¢??you know, little chihuahaÃƒÂ¢??. \n\nCut some of the indian phone guy (trimmed pause at start, cut ÃƒÂ¢??iÃƒÂ¢??m going to ask you to speakÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦.).

IÃƒÂ¢??ve talked to several people I know from the military, and they all told me the would never talk like that on the radio. \n\nTrimmed (panasonic) memory card commercial. Made Maggie stealing the card a little less freaking obvious. \n\nCut Maggie saying ÃƒÂ¢??thereÃƒÂ¢??s only one hacker in the world who can decode this signalÃƒÂ¢??. rearranged video to cut this scene. \n\nCut dance-dance revolution scene. More useless filler. \n\nCut Glen saying ÃƒÂ¢??let me work my magic.ÃƒÂ¢?? \n\nCut GlenÃƒÂ¢??s grandma saying ÃƒÂ¢??are you playin them video games again, making moment of door being kicked in more dramatic. \n\nCut news report in SamÃƒÂ¢??s room. too much info for the network news to have on the base attack. \n\nCut Sam calling Miles and telling him that ÃƒÂ¢??satanÃƒÂ¢??s camaro is stalking himÃƒÂ¢??. Ha-ha. \n\nCut out a few frames of Sam flipping his bike over. The editing was poor, and if you looked at it, they were repeating footage, making it seem like he was in the air too long. \n\nCut several seconds of Sam making small talk with Mikaela after falling off bike (while being chased by his carÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦ that was driving itselfÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦and had turned into a robot the previous night). \n\nCut several seconds of SamÃƒÂ¢??s hesitation to get the f#*k away from a car that just turned into a giant f@%king evil robotÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦. \n\nTrimmed ÃƒÂ¢??this must be a bad dreamÃƒÂ¢?? along with a few frames of transition from Sam on roof of car to Barricade slamming his fist down. \n\nTrimmed a few frames of BarricadeÃƒÂ¢??s two swings at Sam (heÃƒÂ¢??s a lightning fast ninja when fighting Bumblebee, but a lumbering hulk when trying to swat a human?). I also trimmed it to again make Sam look as if he is trying to get away from a GIANT F#@KING ROBOT! \n\nCut ÃƒÂ¢??the car wonÃƒÂ¢??t start. at least we ditched the monster, right?ÃƒÂ¢?? keeps the tension in the car higher. \n\nTrimmed BumblebeeÃƒÂ¢??s ÃƒÂ¢??engine troubleÃƒÂ¢??. He starts himself up and punches it at the right moment. Sam is surprised. \n\nTrimmed Mikaela lingering and staring at the sawzall (there is a freaked out robot attacking her boyfriend after all). \n\nCut out FrenzyÃƒÂ¢??s Looney Tunes running in place/some silly noises during fight with Sam. \n\nCut Sam saying ÃƒÂ¢??not so tough without a head, are you?ÃƒÂ¢??, trimmed transition. \n\nLeft Wilhelm scream!  \n\nCut frenzy shaking his head and saying ÃƒÂ¢??oooohÃƒÂ¢?? to MikaelaÃƒÂ¢??s purse. \n\nCut ÃƒÂ¢??itÃƒÂ¢??s probablyJapanese, yeah, definitely JapaneseÃƒÂ¢?? \n\nTrimmed Sam and Mikaela drooling over BumblebeeÃƒÂ¢??s interior/Bumblebee taking his time sitting in traffic inside a tunnel (while in ÃƒÂ¢??disguiseÃƒÂ¢??). \n\nCut ÃƒÂ¢??excuse me? are you the tooth fairy (barf)? \n\nCut ÃƒÂ¢??whatÃƒÂ¢??s crackin little bitches?ÃƒÂ¢?? \n\nCut the second (SamÃƒÂ¢??s) Ebay plug. \n\nSlightly trimmed ÃƒÂ¢??Scorponoks tailÃƒÂ¢?? scene, making it a little more of a suprise. \n\nCut ÃƒÂ¢??the donut sceneÃƒÂ¢??. \n\nCut kid cutting in on female reporter. \n\nCut the Masturbation scene. \n\nCut Sam and his parents being dragged outside (you touch my dogÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦.donÃƒÂ¢??t talk to anyone until we have a lawyerÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦etc.). \n\nCut Sam saying ÃƒÂ¢??what you mean like ET? pfffftÃƒÂ¢?? I know itÃƒÂ¢??s a reference to Spielberg, and itÃƒÂ¢??s real cute, but ShiaÃƒÂ¢??s acting at that point is a little iffy. \n\nCut ÃƒÂ¢??criminals are hot!ÃƒÂ¢?? \n\nTrimmed Optimus slamming into Sector7 SUV for effect (to make it more of a suprise/shock). \n\nCut Bumblebee pissing scene. I know that the agents are wet in the scene after that, but IÃƒÂ¢??m going to chalk that up to sweat. If anyone can teach me how to clean that up digitally, IÃƒÂ¢??d be glad to, but for now, I just had to get rid of that ridiculous scene. \n\nCut ÃƒÂ¢??whereÃƒÂ¢??s Sector 7? WouldnÃƒÂ¢??t you like to know?ÃƒÂ¢?? \n\nCut FrenzyÃƒÂ¢??s landing/more goofy noises from his fall off dam ledge. \n\nCut Simmons saying ÃƒÂ¢??they know the way of the samurai.ÃƒÂ¢?? \n\nCut Maggie sayingÃƒÂ¢??that thing is freaky! heÃƒÂ¢??s like the little bitty Energizer bunny from hell, eh? \n\nTrimmed end of phone-bots rampage and Simmons saying ÃƒÂ¢??aww, heÃƒÂ¢??s breakin the boxÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦.ÃƒÂ¢?? \n\nCut Frenzy saying ÃƒÂ¢??beeta, beeta, beeta!!ÃƒÂ¢?? \n\nCut ÃƒÂ¢??ok, you want to leave the fate of the world on a kidÃƒÂ¢??s Camaro?ÃƒÂ¢?? \n\nCut Sam asking Bumblebee, ÃƒÂ¢??they didnÃƒÂ¢??t hurt you, right?ÃƒÂ¢?? (Awww, poor wittle robot). \n\nMerged footage of bumblebee looking around and then slamming face shield down. (it was a pain in the dick to line up video/sound spent 4 hours alone on that one 10 second scene. Eat your heart out ILM!). Cut out Sam talking in between shots. \n\nCut Frenzy saying ÃƒÂ¢??duh/uhÃƒÂ¢?? when he tries breaking into the room with the crew. \nTrimmed scene slightly. \n\nTrimmed 4 frames of Secretary of Defense Keller breaking glass to make the timing more realistic. \n\nCut Simmons ÃƒÂ¢??get out of the wayÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢?? trying to blowtorch frenzyÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦..frenzy shooting discs into room, Goodburger screaming about it, Keller sending message, Air Force responding. \n\nCut smiley, dipshit kid sayingÃƒÂ¢?? COOOL MOM!ÃƒÂ¢?? I worked on this longer than any other shot, and should have given up quite frankly, but god I hated it. IÃƒÂ¢??m pretty proud that I got it to work. \n\nCut FRENZY ÃƒÂ¢??OH SHIT!ÃƒÂ¢?? (I know itÃƒÂ¢??s a G1 reference, but itÃƒÂ¢??s gay here.) \n\nCut Epps saying ÃƒÂ¢??that ainÃƒÂ¢??t friendlyÃƒÂ¢??. \n\nCut ÃƒÂ¢??IÃƒÂ¢??ll drive, you shoot!ÃƒÂ¢??. ItÃƒÂ¢??s a weird little mix-up of cuts, that mostly works, but being my most hated line in the whole movie, it just had to be removed. I had to steal sound effects from a different battle to get this one to work. IÃƒÂ¢??m pretty happy with it, considering I got to remove one of the worst lines from the movie. \n\nCut Lennox saying ÃƒÂ¢??uh this isnÃƒÂ¢??t going well.ÃƒÂ¢?? \n\nCut Mikaela saying ÃƒÂ¢??SHOOT! SHOOT!ÃƒÂ¢?? \n\nCut the ÃƒÂ¢??advertisement-botsÃƒÂ¢??. I kind of like Mountain Dew bot, but it was impossible to cut the scene up (without rebuilding the audio track from scratch, fuck that.) to remove the other bots. IÃƒÂ¢??m happy with it, and it keeps things rolling. Besides, there was some awful acting in the whole scene. \n\nTrimmed a couple of seconds in the Allspark hand-off to try and trim the hang time, and increase the urgency. It seemed as if Sam was taking his time to get rid of this thing that giant fucking robots were chasing him for. \n\nLeft in michael bay getting flicked into a car by megatron.  \n\nCut ÃƒÂ¢??bring the rainÃƒÂ¢?? #2 \n\nCried about not being able to cut Link Park song from the end (yet, damn it!). \n\n---------------------------------------------\nFanedit details: DVD contains the edited movie (5.1 mix/anamorphic widescreen), a thank you list and maybe something else tooÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦.\n\nYour intention for this fanedit: To remove most of the over the top, silly parts of the film, and to tighten up the story overall.\n\nYour way to achieve your intention: Trimming small parts of Frenzy, the computer kids, and other extraneous human characters. Eliminating unnecessary dialogue/scenes.\n\nHardware and software information: (Software) DVD Decrypter, Womble, TMPGEnc, DVDFab Decrypter, Adobe Photoshop and DVD-Lab Pro. (Hardware) Pentium D 2.6Ghz Dual core processor, Sony DRU-710A, 2 GB ram.\n\nAdditional Comment: This is the first, ÃƒÂ¢??softÃƒÂ¢?? cut, with a ÃƒÂ¢??hardÃƒÂ¢?? cut and a G1 (Generation One) cut to follow in order.\n\nTime needed for the edition: Planning - 3 months. Editing - 4 months, on and off. Creating DVD - 2 weeks. Yeah, 7 1/2 months. IÃƒÂ¢??m an obsessive compulsive perfectionist. Sue me.\n\npersons involved: 1 (plus some excellent help from a few members who are in the ÃƒÂ¢??Thank youÃƒÂ¢?? list in the DVD menu credits.\n\nAdditional information links:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.originaltrilogy.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=11&amp;threadid=8264&amp;STARTPAGE=1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.originaltrilogy.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=11&amp;threadid=8264&amp;STARTPAGE=1&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://fanedit.org/wpTF/?p=518&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://fanedit.org/wpTF/?p=518&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------------------------------\n\nSEED &amp;#039;TIL YOU BLEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9757ea3dd063dd9fb4131268c59a7fdbe63080df","amp;dn":"Transformers%3A+Resparked+%28fanedit%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9757ea3dd063dd9fb4131268c59a7fdbe63080df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,87,234,61,208,99,221,159,180,19,18,104,197,154,127,219,230,48,128,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
