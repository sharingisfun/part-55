Beneath billowing clouds in China&amp;#039;s far south west, rich jungles nestle below towering peaks. Jewel-coloured birds and ancient tribes share forested valleys where wild elephants still roam. How do these forests exist? Perhaps the rugged landscape holds the key.\n\nPart 2 of 6: &quot;Shangri-La\n\nWild.China.Part2.720p.HDTV.x264-GOTHiC\nRls date: 2008-05-20\nAir date: 2008-05-19\n\nTechnical Specs\n\nCodec: x264\nSource: HDTV 1080 MBAFF\nRes: 1280x720\nAudio: AC3 5.1\nLength: 58:54","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fefcf050e78041a6a8c85c5c251aa70a6a8f2d3","amp;dn":"Wild.China.Part2.720p.HDTV.x264-GOTHiC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fefcf050e78041a6a8c85c5c251aa70a6a8f2d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,239,207,5,14,120,4,26,106,140,133,197,194,81,170,112,166,168,242,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
