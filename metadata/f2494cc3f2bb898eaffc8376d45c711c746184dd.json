Thomas Gates, Ben&amp;#039;s great-grandfather, is mentioned in the page. It shows that Ben&amp;#039;s great-grandfather could have been involved with Abraham Lincoln&amp;#039;s murder. When doing more research, the conspiracy takes Ben, Abigail, and Riley to Buckingham Palace (which they break into). It takes them to a book in the White House (which they break into also) and they even steal a page from the book. But in order to see more from the book, their choice is either get elected president or kidnap the President of the United States. Which do they choose? It&amp;#039;s obvious. The conspiracy then crosses to Mount Rushmore and they even mention the JFK conspiracy. Can Ben clear his family&amp;#039;s name? Or will his family be linked to the murder of Abraham Lincoln?\n\nDirector:        Jon Turteltaub\n\nCountry:         USA\n\nTransfer Format: 1080p\n\nYear:            2007\n\nRunning Time:    124 min\n\nIMDB:           &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0465234/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0465234/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFinalcodec Player \n\ndownload                                                                      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.siluhd.com/soft/FinalCodecs2008sp.exe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.siluhd.com/soft/FinalCodecs2008sp.exe&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou need a powerfull computer to play AVC codec HD\nRecommended: INTEL Core2 DUO or AMD X2 4800+ and ATI 2400 PRO\n\n\nOther movies visit                                                                          \n\n                &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/accpt7506_siluer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/accpt7506_siluer&lt;/a&gt;\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2494cc3f2bb898eaffc8376d45c711c746184dd","amp;dn":"National.Treasure.2.Book.of.Secrets.2007.Blu-ray.REMUX.1080p.h26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2494cc3f2bb898eaffc8376d45c711c746184dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,73,76,195,242,187,137,142,175,252,131,118,212,92,113,28,116,97,132,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
