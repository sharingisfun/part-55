If you wish to redistribute this collection, please include all 12 parts.\r\n\r\nWhat are â€œRegeneratedâ€ ebooks?\r\n\r\n-This is a collection of ebooks, which began their lives as hard copy books, then PDF Scans of individual pages,and in many cases, simply run through a converter to make them into EPUB and/or MOBI files. \r\nThe results were, to put it kindly, less than optimal.\r\nThis collection attempts to correct the situation by reformatting the books in question, removing external (and often non-functional) Table of Contents, in favor of internally generated ToC, proper chapter stops, page breaks and the like. The result is a â€œcleanerâ€™, more consistent (in my opinion) format, that is ultimately easier to read. \r\nSince this collection is made up primarily of Doctor Who books, â€˜Regeneratedâ€™ seemed to be appropriate.\r\n\r\nWhatâ€™s included in this collection?\r\n\r\n- This is a rather long list, and are included as separate documents within each part (â€˜Contents.rtfâ€™). A complete list is included with part 12 (â€˜Contents full.rtfâ€™)\r\n\r\nWhatâ€™s not included in this collection \r\n\r\n- Comics, Graphic Novels, and other heavily illustrated forms of books (as well as magazines) are not, and will not be included in this collection. Therefore, no Cookbooks, Almanacs, Fun Books, Picture Books, or Encyclopedias. \r\n\r\nWhat are the â€œSource Filesâ€ folders, and do I need them?\r\n\r\n- Each Regenerated ebook folder contains a MOBI file (for Kindle eBook readers), a, EPUB file (for most other eBook readers), and a Source Files folder. The Source Files folder contains all the graphics files used in the regenerated eBook, as well as the RTF text file used to generate the eBook (and in many cases, the original PDF file, where I could find them). These files are only necessary if you wish to make modifications to the eBooks yourself. \r\nThese eBooks were created with Legend Maker for the Macintosh (available via the App Store, or the companyâ€™s own web site), and the RTF files are designed to be used with this utility. \r\nThe Source Files ARE NOT needed to use the resulting eBook files, and may be discarded at your discretion. HOWEVER, if you plan on re-distributing this collection, you should include these files.\r\n\r\nIâ€™ve found (and corrected) some errors. What do I do now?\r\n\r\n- At the time of this writing, this collection is wandering the internet, searching for a more permanent home. You may notice that each eBook has a version number placed in the upper right corner of the first page. My hope is that this collection will evolve, and further refined versions of eBooks will take the place of the eBooks Iâ€™ve regenerated for this collection.\r\nIf you find mistakes (and there are plenty, I have no doubt), please make whatever corrections you deem necessary in the RTF file, and check back periodically where you found this collection. If/when a permanent home is located, contact information on where to send your corrections will be included in this read me file at a future date.\r\n\r\nWhy are there non â€˜Doctor Whoâ€™ eBooks included in the â€˜Odds and Endsâ€™ folder (Part 4 of 12)?\r\n\r\n- These books are/were experiments/exercises for me as I was learning how to create/format eBooksâ€¦ The â€˜Big Little Booksâ€™ represent a couple of the collection of these books I had as a child, and it was fun attempting to recreate them here. The â€˜Supermanâ€™ books are a couple of my personal favorites, and were among my first attempts at making eBooks, besides, theyâ€™re just fun to readâ€¦ :-) â€œDoctor Poohâ€™ was just too charming to pass upâ€¦","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77a8fc3f3ddf5ad0a209d132405e2b3cf0d6cf05","amp;dn":"Regenerated+e-Books+-+Doctor+Who+%2812+of+12%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77a8fc3f3ddf5ad0a209d132405e2b3cf0d6cf05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,168,252,63,61,223,90,208,162,9,209,50,64,94,43,60,240,214,207,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
