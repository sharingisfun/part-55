While slowly recovering from his injuries, he rebuilds his son\\&amp;#039;s video camera that was destroyed in the crash. Infused with power from the moment of the crash, the camera develops the ability to stop time when Daniel presses the pause button. This discovery restores Daniel\\&amp;#039;s purpose, and he fills the vacuum in his life by taking responsibility for another victim, Sarah, a newlywed who lost her husband in the same accident. At first Daniel only watches her, then tries to improve her life in small ways. But using his power to \\&quot;help\\&quot; becomes an addiction, and the vastness of Daniel\\&amp;#039;s power can do only one thing...corrupt him.\n\nIMDb: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0989760/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1674585c45ace99247999d15b7251f51d977e14c","amp;dn":"Suspension.DVDRip.Xvid.TFE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1674585c45ace99247999d15b7251f51d977e14c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,116,88,92,69,172,233,146,71,153,157,21,183,37,31,81,217,119,225,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
