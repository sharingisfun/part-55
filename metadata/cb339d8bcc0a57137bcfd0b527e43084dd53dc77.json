Closing in on\ntwo dec-ades on the job, he still hasn&amp;#039;t broken his string of strong\nsinger-songwriter records, without ever wandering anywhere near the\nmainstream-pop spotlight. On Good Time, he doesn&amp;#039;t push himself hard, sticking\nto the familiar themes of &quot;Small Town Southern Man,&quot; &quot;Country Boy&quot; and &quot;Laid\nBack &amp;#039;N Low Key.&quot; When he gets hold of a honky-tonk ditty like &quot;Good Time,&quot; he\nlets it roll on past the five-minute mark just to prove he can. Sometimes he\ngoes overboard, as in &quot;I Still Like Bologna,&quot; where he gets sentimental over\ncold cuts on white bread as a refuge from the world of laptops and cell phones.\nBut his finest songs are always his romantic ballads, and the best one here also\nsounds like the one he wrote the quickest: &quot;1976,&quot; where he sings about meeting\nhis wife in the good old days when &quot;Jimmy Carter moved to D.C./A Georgia boy\njust like me&quot; and reflects, &quot;Wonder Woman sure looked fine/Bionic Man was still\nprime time.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb339d8bcc0a57137bcfd0b527e43084dd53dc77","amp;dn":"Alan+Jackson+-+Good+Time+-+2008+Full+CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb339d8bcc0a57137bcfd0b527e43084dd53dc77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,51,157,139,204,10,87,19,123,207,208,181,39,228,48,132,221,83,220,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
