The new User Interface is easier to learn and \ndesigned to match the UI standards of the CG industry. Now for the first \ntime ever, self-taught, Houdini rookies will be able to work with the software \nright out of the box and be productive much faster than ever before. The \nHoudini 9 user interface features an icon-based shelf which makes it easier \nfor artists to find tools then work in the 3D viewport and Pane tabs that let\nyou layer different types of panes. New selection modes facilitate quicker \nnavigation between different parts of Houdini as you select geometry, \nparticles or dynamic objects in your 3D scene.\n\n[IMG]http://i236.photobucket.com/albums/ff230/Electronburn/Houdini.jpg[/IMG]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e93a79d3f2c8de270262684f800d1b12192a6eb2","amp;dn":"Houdini+9.0.794+Final+32+bit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e93a79d3f2c8de270262684f800d1b12192a6eb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,58,121,211,242,200,222,39,2,98,104,79,128,13,27,18,25,42,110,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
