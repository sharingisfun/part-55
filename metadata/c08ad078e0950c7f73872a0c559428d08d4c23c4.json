Her personal songs are delicate, but also have the elan of someone exploring a musical world with only a rough map. Part of the enchantment is where they end up.&quot;\n\n&quot;Jena Malone and Her Bloodstains are so new in their creation that a bio seems a little out of place. But alas that is how the world works - we must read about everything and know about everything without ever seeing anything. The origin of the music has to be in South Lake Tahoe where Jena began learning about songwriting on her laptop and recording songs with an MBox. She became obsessed with music and the stories she could tell. After 4 months of writing and recording she had finished 2 demos, one with 8 songs and one with 13 songs. Then, like any good mother after birth, she wanted to clean these things and make them grow and show them to the world. ThatÃƒÂ¢??s where the band comes in. An amazing group of musicians came together out of love for the songs and also respect for each other as artists: Russell Simins (Blues Explosion), Chris Maxwell (Skeleton Key), Louis Schwadron, Adam Crystal (Dopo Yume) and Jena Malone.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c08ad078e0950c7f73872a0c559428d08d4c23c4","amp;dn":"Jena+Malone+and+Her+Bloodstains","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c08ad078e0950c7f73872a0c559428d08d4c23c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,138,208,120,224,149,12,127,115,135,42,12,85,148,40,208,141,76,35,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
