Check out\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://blog.wolfram.com/2008/02/mathematica602arrives.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://blog.wolfram.com/2008/02/mathematica602arrives.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nfor more information\n\n&quot;In my ten years at Wolfram Research, I&amp;#039;ve never seen so much software\ndevelopment activity. In the middle of last year, we had our biggest\nlaunch in a decade: Mathematica 6. Now there&amp;#039;s a huge pipeline of new\ndevelopment underway\n\nSome people are working on Mathematica 7 some people on Mathematica 8\n\nWe&amp;#039;re developing major new frameworks and we&amp;#039;re adding boatloads of new\nfunctions. But we&amp;#039;re also continuing to polish and strengthen everything\nthat&amp;#039;s already in Mathematica\n\nWe brought out Mathematica 6.0.1 last summer to add a variety of\nimprovements that didn&amp;#039;t make it into 6.0.0. And we&amp;#039;ve now accumulated\nenough improvements that we&amp;#039;ve decided to release 6.0.2 - which is being\nsent to Premier Service customers as of today\n\n6.0.2 is not about major new features instead, it&amp;#039;s about adding,\nsmoothing, and rounding out features in Mathematica 6.0.0\n\nFor most users, the most obvious of the various changes in 6.0.2 is in the\nDocumentation Center\n\nWe&amp;#039;ve added a new navigation mechanism to every function page, with tens of\nthousands of new links\n\nOpen up the Documentation Center, and you&amp;#039;ll see two new elements: the\nFunction Navigator and the Virtual Book\n\nThe Function Navigator is a complete hierarchical tool for navigating all\n2500 functions of Mathematica. The Virtual Book starts from the full text\nof Stephen Wolfram&amp;#039;s The Mathematica Book, then adds thousands of pages of\nnew and more advanced documentation\n\nWe studied how people prefer to find information inside Mathematica. Not\nsurprisingly, we discovered that different people are different. Some like\nusing our conceptual overview &quot;guide pages&quot;. Some like using text search\nAnd some like using hierarchical function navigation - or a book-like table\nof contents\n\nIn Mathematica 5, we had a primitive Function Navigator - and we also had\nThe Mathematica Book. We weren&amp;#039;t sure these could scale up to a system the\nsize of Mathematica 6. But as soon as Mathematica 6 came out, it was clear\npeople wanted us to try to figure out how to do this\n\nI&amp;#039;m happy to say that we succeeded, and Mathematica 6.0.2 contains a full\nFunction Navigator and Virtual Book\n\nWe&amp;#039;re planning still more innovations in this direction in the future. But\nour tests indicate that Mathematica 6.0.2 is a significant step in helping\npeople to find the information they need to use Mathematica as productively\nas possible\n\nThere&amp;#039;s quite a bit else in Mathematica 6.0.2 as well\n\nIn interactive graphics, we&amp;#039;ve spruced up the Drawing Tools palette,\nparticularly adding a rather sophisticated coordinate-picking tool for\ndigitizing graphics\n\nFine-tuning some of our low-level software infrastructure allowed us to\nmake some surprisingly dramatic improvements (sometimes a factor of 50) in\nspeed for various forms of Import and Export. This particularly affects\nbinary files on all platforms, as well as many graphics formats on Mac\nand Unix platforms\n\nWe&amp;#039;ve been pleased to see how deeply all the new Import and Export\ncapabilities of Mathematica 6 are being adopted. And as users have\nconnected Mathematica to a broader range of external programs and\nsystems, some subtle but important issues have come to light\n\nMathematica 6.0.2 addresses many of these. A few examples are dramatic\ncompression of graphics that include transparency exported to PDF, more\nrobust embedding of graphics in TeX, and full support for all metadata\nin FITS images\n\nFinally, we always work hard to let Mathematica take advantage of all the\nlatest enhancements in hardware and operating systems (and Mathematica\nhas a long tradition of being the very first complex application on major\nnew platforms). The hardware for 64-bit Intel Macs had been released\nbefore Mathematica 6, but the operating system wasn&amp;#039;t yet ready to support\na complex application like Mathematica\n\nAfter working closely with our partners at Apple, I&amp;#039;m happy to say it now\nis, and so Mathematica 6.0.2 fully supports 64-bit Intel Macs\n\nMathematica 6.0.2 has very useful enhancements, particularly in\ndocumentation and performance, that we expect all users will appreciate\ntoday\n\nLong recognized as the world&amp;#039;s most powerful mathematical software system,\nMathematica has steadily grown in breadth and depth to become today an\nunparalleled platform for all forms of computation\n\nPowering innovation in research, development, and education\n\nWith thousands of original algorithms and a tightly unified overall design,\nMathematica spans projects of all sizes, from simple calculator operations\nand educational demonstrations to large-scale systems deployment and\nmaximum-power supercomputing\n\nThe most important advance in the 20 year history of Mathematica\n\nBuilding on two decades of world-class algorithm and software development,\nMathematica 6 represents a dramatic breakthrough that immensely broadens\nMathematicas scope and applicability, and redefines the very way we think\nabout computation\n\nMade possible by Mathematica&amp;#039;s unique symbolic architecture, Mathematica 6\nintroduces a sweeping unification of language and interface concepts that\nmakes possible a new level of automation in algorithmic computation,\ninteractive manipulation and dynamic presentation, as well as a whole new\nway of interacting with the world of data\n\nMathematica 6.0 fundamentally redefines Mathematica and introduces a major\nnew paradigm for computation\n\nBuilding on Mathematica&amp;#039;s time-tested core symbolic architecture, version\n6.0 adds nearly a thousand new functions almost doubling the total number\nof functions in the system, dramatically increasing both the breadth and\ndepth of Mathematica&amp;#039;s capabilities, as well as introducing hundreds of\nmajor original algorithms, and perhaps a thousand new ideas, large and\nsmall\n\nINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS\n\n1.
