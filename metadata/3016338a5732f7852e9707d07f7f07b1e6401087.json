The Widow from Red Rock  11/26/1967 \nBilly Blue Cannon faces possible hanging when he is court-martialed on the charge of killing an army general&amp;#039;s son. Billy Blue saves an Indian girl from advances by a drunken army lieutenant, who is killed in the fight. When the girl flees to the Apache stronghold, Buck and Manolito risk their lives to persuade Cochise to release Blue&amp;#039;s only eyewitness. Her testimony is discarded when the court learns her release was obtained by a bribe. It becomes obvious to John Cannon that the court-appointed defense is incapable of saving Billy Blue, and John personally takes over his son&amp;#039;s defense.\nWriter: Michael Fessier\nDirector: Robert Sparr\nGuest star: Patricia Barry (Mrs. Melanie Cawthorne), Duke Cigrang (Strobe), I. Stanford Jolley (Foreman), Carlos Romero (I) (Romero)\n\n14.
