As usual, introduced by Bo Kaan, a rebellious musician\n\nhimself (who thinks that American&amp;#039;s and others who eat meat are the cause of\n\nglobal warming... whatever)\n\nAnyways, this is Andy relaxed and on target doing original \n\nsongs like &quot;Virginia&amp;#039;s Vagina&quot; and &quot;Evolution Is Revolution&quot;. Good shit!\n\nRoll a fatty, kick back, listen and enjoy ...\n\ngoogle andy warstar - visit www.andywarstar.com - for the warheads!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c35af32cd11b4e2edfaf349f16b7f9a489385b82","amp;dn":"Andy+Warstar+-+05%2F20%2F07+Nimbin%2C+Oz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c35af32cd11b4e2edfaf349f16b7f9a489385b82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,90,243,44,209,27,78,46,223,175,52,159,22,183,249,164,137,56,91,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
