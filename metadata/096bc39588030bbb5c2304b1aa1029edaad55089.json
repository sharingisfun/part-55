Those musicians developed one of the better examples of prog-folk or folk-prog. The original line-up consisted of main writer Martin Cockerham as singer and guitarist, the beautiful and well known to progheads Barbara Gaskin on vocals, Steve Borrill on bass and Julian Cusack on violin. Although Dave Mattacks (of FAIRPORT CONVENTION fame) played drums on all three SPIROGYRA albums, he was never a member but a guest on the albums.\n\nTheir first album, \\&quot;St-Radiguns\\&quot; was quite successful and very adventurous and can compared to COMUS\\&amp;#039;s First Utterances. Very moody, politically conscious songs full of great interplay (much like THE TREES) and with a great duo of voices in the COMUS or JEFFERSON AIRPLANE manner are the main assets of the highly recommended album.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:096bc39588030bbb5c2304b1aa1029edaad55089","amp;dn":"Spirogyra+-+St.+Radigunds+%5B1971%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"096bc39588030bbb5c2304b1aa1029edaad55089","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,107,195,149,136,3,11,187,92,35,4,177,170,16,41,237,170,213,80,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
