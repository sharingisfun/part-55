If you like this album buy it at http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013AUXY4/ref=sr_f2_album_1?ie=UTF8&amp;child=B0013AMX2Y&amp;qid=1211170429&amp;sr=102-1\n\n\n&quot;In the midst of the strip-mall and cover band plethora of Tulsa, OK, a different approach is made by a band to sever this inaccurate tie. The band known as RadioRadio is bridging the gap between late ÃƒÂ¢??80s electronic and dance rock with more current loud guitars and chunky bass lines.\nPlaying many dates in and around the Midwest (with notable acts like Go Van Gogh and Tobi Kai) make RadioRadio a staple in the Midwest rock music scene. DonÃƒÂ¢??t be fooled, however, in TulsaÃƒÂ¢??s commonplace appearance of a fruitful breeding ground of musical talent. ÃƒÂ¢??Tulsa is a great proving ground, though I believe you need to get and tour regionally as much as possible. There are a limited number of clubs that feature original music here,ÃƒÂ¢?? says RR bassist Paul Cristiano about their scene.\nAlready under RRÃƒÂ¢??s belt is an independent release; it sounds as if they have been making dance rock music for many years. Haunting ballads like ÃƒÂ¢??Bed Check (Beaming Love)ÃƒÂ¢?? and ÃƒÂ¢??The GameÃƒÂ¢?? form a certain Snow Patrol-meets-Nine Inch Nails essence of RR. ItÃƒÂ¢??s as if they like what they are doing and know listeners to like it, too.\nDonÃƒÂ¢??t expect this band, however, to gloat over their talent. ÃƒÂ¢??WeÃƒÂ¢??ve always had the philosophy that our competition isnÃƒÂ¢??t the next best local or regional act, but the national acts we consider our contemporaries. We donÃƒÂ¢??t take anything for granted, we always play like weÃƒÂ¢??re six points down,ÃƒÂ¢?? says Cristiano about their modest stance in the Midwest music scene.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9e261b9cdb95f19a1d7fa08bb58122696384eea","amp;dn":"RadioRadio+--+Watch+%5C%27Em+All+COme+Runnin%5C%27","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9e261b9cdb95f19a1d7fa08bb58122696384eea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,226,97,185,205,185,95,25,161,215,250,8,187,88,18,38,150,56,78,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
