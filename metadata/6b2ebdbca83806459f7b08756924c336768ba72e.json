Muhammad, its lone prophet, conceived his religion solely to satiate his lust for power, sex, and money. He was a terrorist. And if you think these conclusions are shocking, wait until you see the evidence.\n\nThe critics of this work will claim that Prophet of Doom is offensive, racist, hatemongering, intolerant, and unnecessarily violent. I agree - but I didn&amp;#039;t write those parts. They came directly from Islam&amp;#039;s scriptures. If you don&amp;#039;t like what Muhammad and Allah said, don&amp;#039;t blame me. I&amp;#039;m just the messenger.\n\nOthers will say that I cherry-picked the worst of Islam to render an unfair verdict. They will charge that I took the Islamic scriptures out of context to smear Muhammad and Allah. But none of that is true. Over the course of these pages, I quote from almost every surah in the Qur&amp;#039;an - many are presented in their entirety. But more than that, I put each verse in the context of Muhammad&amp;#039;s life, quoting vociferously from the Sunnah as recorded by Bukhari, Muslim, Ishaq, and Tabari - Islam&amp;#039;s earliest and more trusted sources. I even arrange all of this material chronologically, from creation to terror.\n\nPredicting what he called the &quot;Day of Doom&quot; was Muhammad&amp;#039;s most often repeated prophecy. While it did not occur as he foretold in 1110 A.D., it nonetheless came true. Muslims and infidels alike have been doomed by Islam.\n\nTo discover why, we shall dive into the oldest surviving written evidence. These official works include: the Sira, Ta&amp;#039;rikh, Hadith, and Qur&amp;#039;an. Ishaq&amp;#039;s Sira, or biography, called Sirat Rasul Allah, provides the lone account of Muhammad&amp;#039;s life and the formation of Islam written within 200 years of the prophet&amp;#039;s death. While the character, message, and deeds portrayed within its pages are the antithesis of Yahshua&amp;#039;s and his disciples, the Sira&amp;#039;s chronological presentation is similar in style to the Christian Gospels. The Ta&amp;#039;rikh is the oldest, most trusted and comprehensive history of Islam&amp;#039;s formation and Muhammad&amp;#039;s example, called Sunnah. It was written by Tabari. His History of al-Tabari is formatted like the Bible. It begins with Islamic creation and ends with the acts of Muhammad&amp;#039;s companions. Tabari is a compilation of Hadith quotes and Qur&amp;#039;an passages. As such, it provides the best skeleton upon which to flesh out the character of Muhammad and the nature of fundamental Islam. A Hadith is an oral report from Muhammad or his companions. Muslims believe that Hadith were inspired by Allah, making them scripture. The most revered Collection was compiled in a topical arrangement by Bukhari. Allah&amp;#039;s Book, the Qur&amp;#039;an, lacks context and chronology, so to understand it, readers are dependent upon the Sira, Ta&amp;#039;rikh, and Hadith.\n\nAll that can be known about Muhammad&amp;#039;s deeds, means, motives, god, and scripture is enshrined in these books. In their pages you will see them as they saw themselves. My only point of departure from Ishaq and Tabari will be the comprehensive review of the early Meccan surahs, a period in which they had very little to say. Our paths will join again as we approach Islam&amp;#039;s midlife crisis: the Quraysh Bargain, Satanic Verses, Night&amp;#039;s Journey, and Pledge of Aqaba - a declaration of war against all mankind. At this point, the Sunnah speaks more clearly than the Qur&amp;#039;an.\n\nSo that there will be no confusion, I have set the passages from Islam&amp;#039;s scripture in bold-faced type . When quoting from the Qur&amp;#039;an and Hadith, I have elected to use a blended translation. No language transfers perfectly - one word to another. Five of my twelve translations of the Qur&amp;#039;an were combined to create the most accurate conveyance of the message possible. However, the writing quality is so poor, the proofreaders of this manuscript suggested that I help Allah and Muhammad out by cleaning up their grammar, punctuation, and verbosity. So for clarity and readability, I have trimmed their unruly word patterns and meaningless repetitions, being careful not to alter the meaning or message of any passage. Insertions within parenthesis (like this) were added by the Arabic translators to fill in missing words or to clarify the text. Insertions within brackets [like this] represent my observations.\n\nI have elected to present Islam&amp;#039;s original source material in juxtaposition to my evaluation of its veracity. This format is similar to that used by the first English translators of Mein Kampf as they attempted to warn America about the dangers lurking in Hitler&amp;#039;s manifesto. They, as I, found it necessary to hold the author accountable. A great deal was at stake then, as it is today. The last time the world was ignorant of such a hateful and violent doctrine, 55 million people died. If we don&amp;#039;t shed our ignorance of Islam, many more will perish.\n\nMy quest to understand Islam began on the morning of September 11th 2001. I wanted to know why Muslim militants were killing us. So I went off to Ground Zero for Islamic terror - Israel. The West Bank is home to more suicide bombers per capita than anywhere else on earth. I arranged to meet with the terrorists themselves. I asked members of al-Qaeda, Islamic Jihad, al-Aqsa Martyrs&amp;#039; Brigade, and Hamas why they were killing us. They said, &quot;Islam. We are following Muhammad&amp;#039;s orders.&quot; That adventure is recounted in Tea With Terrorists . It covers a wide range of material and serves as a companion volume, connecting fundamental Islam to terrorism. Prophet of Doom focuses strictly on what the Islamic scriptures have to say.\n\nSo, could it be? Could a prophet and a religion be responsible for today&amp;#039;s terrorist attacks? I invested 10,000 hours in pursuit of that answer. I wish everyone had. But knowing that not all are able, I have distilled what I discovered into these pages.\n\nNow for a word of caution: this journey of discovery is ordered chronologically. It is not prioritized by relevance. Explaining the root cause of Islamic terror is the biggest priority; yet it is not exposed until the last half of the book. I want you to know Muhammad, Allah, and Islam before you judge their legacy. So to keep you turning pages, I have endeavored to make Islam&amp;#039;s early years as entertaining as possible. While Prophet of Doom is meticulously researched, documented, and accurate, it&amp;#039;s written as if you and I were old friends having a lively chat about the most important and lethal issue of our day.\n\nOne last thought before you head down this perilous path. I pray that when you have reached the journey&amp;#039;s end, you will share my heart for the plight of Muslims. I want nothing more than to free them from Islam, and in so doing, free us from the terror their doctrine inspires\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b2ebdbca83806459f7b08756924c336768ba72e","amp;dn":"prophet+of+doom+12+delusions+of+grandeur","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b2ebdbca83806459f7b08756924c336768ba72e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,46,189,188,168,56,6,69,159,123,8,117,105,36,195,54,118,139,167,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
