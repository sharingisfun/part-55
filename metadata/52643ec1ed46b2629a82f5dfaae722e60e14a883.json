They are joined by The Dutchman\\&amp;#039;s young new friend Luis (Nino Castelnuovo), who used to be an acrobat. Gathered together, The Dutchman reveals his scheme, which seems like suicide: To rob $500,000 of gold from a train that is not only covered with soldiers equipped with rifles, machine guns, and a cannon, but traveling along a route that passes squadrons of armed soldiers on horseback every six minutes.\n\nThe rest you must watch for yourself to enjoy!!!!!\n\nWell, if you\\&amp;#039;ve already watched it when you were younger.....Treasure this WESTERN CLASSIC!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52643ec1ed46b2629a82f5dfaae722e60e14a883","amp;dn":"The+Five+Man+Army+%281969-Western%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52643ec1ed46b2629a82f5dfaae722e60e14a883","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,100,62,193,237,70,178,98,154,130,245,223,170,231,34,230,14,20,168,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
