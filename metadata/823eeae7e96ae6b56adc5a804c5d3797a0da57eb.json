There are scenes in this movie that will invariably\nbecome indelibly etched in the viewers imagination: The opening funeral \nmarch through the vast Siberian landscape, the grandeur of the Czarist \nRussian palaces, the march of the revolutionaries through the Moscow \nboulevards, the train ride\nstraight out of Dante\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Inferno, the Ice-covered interior of the Zhivago \ncountry estate (a truly magical moment in the film), the wealth of \nbeauty captured in the cinematography of this film is astonishing. \nJulie Christie\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Lara is one of those great screen personas--she \nbecomes a woman of such mysterious beauty. The\nfinal scene of Yuri\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s desperate attempt to reach her in the crowded \nSoviet Moscow is heartbreaking. And that music score! The opening film \ncredits with Jarre\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s genuinely beautiful music, complete with balalaikas \nsets the mood for this great, grand entertainment. One of the best ever!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:823eeae7e96ae6b56adc5a804c5d3797a0da57eb","amp;dn":"Doctor_Zhivago_DVDRIP_ENG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"823eeae7e96ae6b56adc5a804c5d3797a0da57eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,62,234,231,233,106,230,181,106,220,90,128,76,93,55,151,160,218,87,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
