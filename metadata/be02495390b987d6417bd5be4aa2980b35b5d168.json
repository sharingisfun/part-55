Both are compilation albums and therefore excellent.\n\nIn my opinion (and I&amp;#039;m a huge Stones fan), these are the two best possible compilations (let alone alumbs) to have of the Rolling Stones, as together they contain pretty much every one of the Stones&amp;#039; greatest songs. The London Years was produced some time ago, and went platinum and 40 Licks was produced more recently and went quadruple platinum (in the USA alone).\n\n40 Licks:\n\nDisc one:\n&quot;Come On&quot; (Chuck Berry) 1:48 \n&quot;I Want to Be Loved&quot; (Willie Dixon) 1:52 \n&quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot; (John Lennon/Paul McCartney) 1:43 \n&quot;Stoned&quot; (Nanker Phelge) 2:09 \n&quot;Not Fade Away&quot; (Charles Hardin/Norman Petty) 1:47 \n&quot;Little by Little&quot; (Nanker Phelge/Phil Spector)  2:39 \n&quot;It&amp;#039;s All Over Now&quot; (Bobby Womack/Shirley Jean Womack)3:27 \n&quot;Good Times, Bad Times&quot; 2:31 \n&quot;Tell Me&quot; 2:47 \n&quot;I Just Want to Make Love to You&quot; (Willie Dixon)2:17 \n&quot;Time Is on My Side&quot; (Norman Meade) 2:53 \nOrgan version.
