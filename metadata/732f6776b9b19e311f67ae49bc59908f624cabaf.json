And what a supporting cast - in addition to Nicholson (at his most subtle, something he doesn't always do), there's Harry Dean Stanton, Benecio Del Toro, Tom Noonan, Vanessa Redgrave, Robin Wright Penn, the list goes on and on with the best charactor actors around. Del Toro does something completely different once again. The story is very moving and almost at the level of a Greek tragedy. Beautifully shot and edited with good use of score. The best drama I've seen in quite a while.\n\n\nQualidade de VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­deo: DVD Rip\nVÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­deo Codec: XViD\nVÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­deo Bitrate: 192 Kbps\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½udio Codec: AC3\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½udio Bitrate: 192\nResoluÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o: 576 x 384\nFormato de Tela: Tela Cheia (4x3)\nFrame Rate: 23.976 FPS\nTamanho: 1,4 Gb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:732f6776b9b19e311f67ae49bc59908f624cabaf","amp;dn":"Sean+Penn+-+The+Pledge+%28A+Promessa%29+-+2001+-+EUA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"732f6776b9b19e311f67ae49bc59908f624cabaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,47,103,118,185,177,158,49,31,103,174,73,188,89,144,143,98,76,171,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
