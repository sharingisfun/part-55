Now, in The Godfather \nReturns, acclaimed novelist Mark Winegardner continues the story?the \nyears not covered in Puzo&amp;#039;s bestselling book or in Francis Ford Coppola&amp;#039;s \nclassic films.\n\nIt is 1955. Michael Corleone has won a bloody victory in the war among New \nYork&amp;#039;s crime families. Now he wants to consolidate his power, save his \nmarriage, and take his family into legitimate businesses. To do so, he must \nconfront his most dangerous adversary yet, Nick Geraci, a former boxer who \nworked his way through law school as a Corleone street enforcer, and who is \nevery bit as deadly and cunning as Michael. Their personal cold war will run \nfrom 1955 to 1962, exerting immense influence on the lives of America&amp;#039;s most \npowerful criminals and their loved ones.\n\nSweeping from New York and Washington to Las Vegas and Cuba, The \nGodfather Returns is the spellbinding story of America&amp;#039;s criminal underworld \nat mid-century and its intersection with the political, legal, and entertainment \nempires. The Godfather Returns stands on its own as a triumph?in a tale \nabout what we love, yearn for, and sometimes have reason to fear...family.\n\n----\n\nMark Winegardner received a master of fine arts degree in fiction writing from \nGeorge Mason University and published his first book at age twenty-six, while \nstill in graduate school. His books have been chosen as among the best of the \nyear by The New York Times Book Review, Chicago Sun-Times, Los Angeles \nTimes, USA Today, and the New York Public Library. He is now a professor \nand director of the creative writing program at Florida State University in \nTallahassee, Florida.\n\n----\n\nScott Brick has performed on film, television, and radio. His stage \nappearances throughout the United States include Cyrano, Hamlet, and \nMacbeth. In the audio industry, Scott has won thirteen Earphone Awards, \nand AudioFile magazine named him &quot;one of the fastest-rising stars in the \naudiobook galaxy.&quot;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc408b65e68395e14aa524ef19cb6ee02ed367f5","amp;dn":"Mark+Winegardner+-+The+Godfather+Returns","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc408b65e68395e14aa524ef19cb6ee02ed367f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,64,139,101,230,131,149,225,74,165,36,239,25,203,110,224,46,211,103,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
