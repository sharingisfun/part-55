The only flaw is that the cd appears to be slightly uneven on the whole, with the predictable &quot;take it away&quot; or the useless instrumental tune &quot;Jizz da pit.&quot; To conclude I would confess I really like this one and advise it to any bloke who like good music.\nSubmitted by emerson1 (tOULOUSE, France)\nWas This Review Helpful? Yes No\n\n Amazing !\nI really recommend this album, great music, different styles, different songs. I liked it a lot... you can&amp;#039;t miss it.\nSubmitted by Pentem (Montevideo, Uruguay)\nWas This Review Helpful? Yes No\n\n Snakepit Rocks!\nOk this album is very good, i would say all songs r well performed and i think the best thing is, s that gn&amp;#039;r members Gilby Clarke, and Matt Sorum play on this cd and one song is written w/ Duff McKagan so it still kinda has that GN&amp;#039;R sound\nSubmitted by Adam (&quot;Ottawa, IL, USA)\nWas This Review Helpful? \n \n \n 1.
