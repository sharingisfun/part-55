Dom writes, &quot;This mod was an occasion for me to exercise my passion for history, gaming and drawing. But perhaps what I am most proud of, is that some of the best modders came together with me to help materialize my dream of simulating the landing of the V corps on these bloody beaches and to try to recreate these 5 days of fighting to secure the small beachhead between the towns of Isigny, Grandcamp, Port-en-Bessin and Trevieres. Why have I choosen Omaha for a CCV mod? I think that this area was perfect for an 1/1 operational scale. We designed this mod with a very high degree of historical accuracy but ofcourse we had to make compromises with the game engine. I choose this mod also because, by chance, I am a resident of Normandy, and I love so much this countryside, the sea and all these lovely little villages. This mod is also in memory of all these young men, Americans and Germans, who fought and fell on the ground of France.&quot;\n\n\nInstallation: 1.
