Despite the lack of commentary/narration, there are still strong narrative elements and continuity throughout.  The images and sounds of the birds themselves do indeed speak for themselves.  This is a most refreshing change from nature documentaries that try to explain every little thing about animal behavior, some going even to the length of anthropomorphizing animals by dubbing in human voices to speak for them.  I&amp;#039;ve watched this movie numerous times and have not yet tired of it.  I&amp;#039;m not even much of an animal or nature lover.\n\nIMDB Description: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0301727/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3b41faacee6bee03a0c0df124300cf6ae5c3093","amp;dn":"Peuple_Migrateur+-+XVID+-+d_mansen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3b41faacee6bee03a0c0df124300cf6ae5c3093","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,180,31,170,206,230,190,224,58,12,13,241,36,48,12,246,174,92,48,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
