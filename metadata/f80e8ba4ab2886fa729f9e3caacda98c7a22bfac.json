No design is too ambitious, and no obstacle too large in their quest for the perfect house.\r\nFollowing the internationally successful Grand Designs format, the series will see the process of these incredible design projects, as well as the personal journeys of those building them - from the initial blueprints, through to the long and often arduous task of turning the plans into practical living spaces.\r\nUsing archaic or new-school building techniques and material, and locations from the beach, to the mountains, and the hills in between, Grand Designs New Zealand will feature houses ranging from architectural designer mansions to DIY homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5)  45 Degree House \r\nNic Ballara clearly has a head for heights as he starts to build a family home for him and his wife Callie and their 12-year-old daughter. Nic's site in the earthquake prone city of Wellington is so steep that it looks virtually impossible to build on, however Nic is convinced he has a solution and is determined to build his first home there. A logistical nightmare lies ahead as this Grand Design looks to be an uphill battle throughout.\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a7/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8b/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2c/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9f/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ac/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/de/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/13/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/33/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e2/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/be/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fc/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/79/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1e/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/09/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c0/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/02/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3164 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 45mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 8\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1,017 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.tv3.co.nz/Shows/GrandDesignsNZ.aspx","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f80e8ba4ab2886fa729f9e3caacda98c7a22bfac","amp;dn":"Grand+Designs+New+Zealand+Series+1+5of8+45+Degree+House+720p+x26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f80e8ba4ab2886fa729f9e3caacda98c7a22bfac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,14,139,164,171,40,134,250,114,159,158,60,170,205,169,140,122,34,191,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
