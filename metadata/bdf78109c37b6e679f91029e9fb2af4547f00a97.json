Up to four players, \nEnglish and German texts. Nice\nEGA/VGA-graphics, animations. (1993 release)\nAuthor: Peter Steffen, ASP, www.pssoft.de\n\n\nWhat is CRIME FIGHTER?\n      ----------------------\n      Crime Fighter is a game for up to four players. \n\n      In contrast to many other games and unlike the name of the\n      game announces, you don&amp;#039;t fight against crimes, but you try to\n      commit as many of them as possible. For example you can play\n      pickpocket, raid supermarkets and hotels, steal cars, raid\n      banks, attack mail trains, and so on. Since you are in a big\n      town you have many different opportunities for this. As soon\n      as you have a high standing in the criminal underworld, you\n      are also able to sign on gangsters that join your gang. These\n      gangsters then can be trained or equipped with weapons (for\n      example with pistols or machine guns). Your aim is to seize\n      the power in the underworld. But the way is very dangerous,\n      especially since the other players try exactly the same. And\n      also the police are hard on your heels....\n\n      But be careful: Crime Fighter is absolutely addictive.\n\n\n\nNote: I used to play this game for hours on end back in the day. A lot of fun to play if you&amp;#039;re really bored, or on a low-end system [or if you can&amp;#039;t play a high performance game because you&amp;#039;re DL/UL are maxed out waiting for GTA ;-)]\n\nI&amp;#039;m on XP and don&amp;#039;t have to run in compatibility mode or anything... but if you have problems running the game, that&amp;#039;s probably what you&amp;#039;ll have to do. Oh, and to install, just double click the &amp;#039;install&amp;#039; app.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdf78109c37b6e679f91029e9fb2af4547f00a97","amp;dn":"Crime+Fighter+%28MsDos+gangster+game%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdf78109c37b6e679f91029e9fb2af4547f00a97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,247,129,9,195,123,110,103,159,145,2,158,159,178,175,69,71,240,10,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
