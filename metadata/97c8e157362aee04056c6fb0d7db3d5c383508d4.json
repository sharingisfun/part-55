In my opinion it is the landmark movie that stands out because of its content and music and story telling style. Probably people identify him/herself with this movie to a great extent that it brings back the tune of nostalgia and responsibility.\n\nDirected by: Ritwik Ghatak","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97c8e157362aee04056c6fb0d7db3d5c383508d4","amp;dn":"Komal+Gandhar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97c8e157362aee04056c6fb0d7db3d5c383508d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,200,225,87,54,42,238,4,5,108,111,176,215,219,61,92,56,53,8,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
