All feedback/bug reports/suggestions welcome.

Go Antix!\n\n*Only &amp;#039;slim&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;catfish&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;xorg&amp;#039; files are from Lenny. Everything else is from the regular Mepis repos.\n\nKnown issues\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-Using the &quot;Restart&quot; Fluxbox button in the menu seems to cause excessive CPU usage. I have not found the cause yet.\n\n-Even after many attempts at editing the sudoers file (with the &amp;#039;visudo&amp;#039; command), I was unable to put a &quot;Shutdown&quot; &amp; &quot;Reboot&quot; in the menu without giving a password. Sorry for the inconvienience. If you can fix it, let me know how you did it!!\n\n-I recommend a &amp;#039;update all&amp;#039; with Synaptic upon installation. Seems to make flash work.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nP.S.
