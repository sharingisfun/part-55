Do you like the Lord of the Rings films but find they move too quickly and make too much sense?\n\nDid you enjoy The Matrix but wish it could have contained a horrendously embarrassing performance by former actor/professional picnic ham John Malkovich? Then you need help! That is, then Eragon is the film for you!\n\nOstensibly about some punk who finds a dragon egg, Eragon is actually a poignant onscreen documentation of the decline of Jeremy Irons, whose eye bags, if there were any justice, would have received third billing. And it&amp;#039;s also a showcase for first time actor - um- can&amp;#039;t remember his name. Really made no impression one way or the other. (In fact, was he even in the film?)\n\nBut mostly it&amp;#039;s an opportunity to watch John Malkovich turn in a performance that had to - HAD TO - be a direct challenge to the director, &quot;Please, fire me.I&amp;#039;m begging you to fire me. I&amp;#039;ll do a take like this and then you&amp;#039;ll have to fire me. Wait,I&amp;#039;m still not fired?&quot;\n\nKevin Murphy joins Mike in the RiffTrax International Studios (and Small Engine Repair) for Eragon, the blockbuster fantasy epic that forgets to be a blockbuster.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rifftrax.com/donate&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rifftrax.com/donate&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n**This is the proper version**","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8313001a4fba49d3dd7c265228120b290d7106be","amp;dn":"Eragon+Rifftrax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8313001a4fba49d3dd7c265228120b290d7106be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,19,0,26,79,186,73,211,221,124,38,82,40,18,11,41,13,113,6,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
