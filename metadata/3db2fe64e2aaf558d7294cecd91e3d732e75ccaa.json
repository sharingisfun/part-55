Originally created for and broadcast on AMC.\n\n\nThe below was AMC website (back when you could find anything about this show there):\n\nWill AMC be re-broadcasting or airing new episodes of &quot;Remember WENN&quot;?  There are no plans to re-broadcast or produce additional episodes of &quot;Remember WENN,&quot; nor is it available for purchase.\n\nAMC has continued to state that WENN is not licensed for sale and will not\nbe licensed for sale. I am strongly opposed to pirates profiting from\nothers&amp;#039; work; it should be shared among fans freely if we cannot obtain it\nin a way that would support the artists.\n\nI do very strongly support actually paying the creators, of course. I&amp;#039;ve\nspent too much time in green rooms with starving artists to think\notherwise. :-) The day I learn that AMC has licensed WENN for legal\npurchase, these torrents will be disabled and I will purchase a full set of\nhigh-quality DVDs as soon as they are available.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3db2fe64e2aaf558d7294cecd91e3d732e75ccaa","amp;dn":"Remember+WENN+Ep+01","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3db2fe64e2aaf558d7294cecd91e3d732e75ccaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,178,254,100,226,170,245,88,215,41,76,236,217,30,61,115,46,117,204,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
