So if you got a Divx enabled DVD player like me you should have no problems.\n\n\n\tJust a note to the groups Please consider Encoding your HD/Bluray in Divx 1080 because anyone that can play 720p h264 would be able to play a 1080p Divx even easier (ATI 9000 - 3870 and NVIDIA FX - 9800) support hardware 1080p Divx decoding, thats 10 year old hardware. Not to mention the Quality would look a lot better compared to a 720p (Honestly ask yourself does a 720p or a 1080p Highest compression and 4x4Q look better?) Your not going to find to meany that CAN&amp;#039;T play the 1080p Divx ver. But obviously in the future when the rest of the market has cought up in CPU/GPU then go to h264 so you can make the file size smaller. \n\n\tPeople are to easily impressed with a # increase 264 from 263+. 264 is just a compression improvement not quality thats why it eats CPU time. And Divx can do 4x4Q as well. If you don&amp;#039;t believe me encode a 1080p movie in Divx 2-pass with 4x4Q on and compare it to a 264 ver (also ask a friend without telling him what you did different and see if he can spot it and look at the CPU power needed vs 264 and quality difference on a 8GB file and you will see you wont find any. But you would see a little difference on a 4GB file so please consider it so we don&amp;#039;t have to re download and burn all are 720p movies again in the future. Or more to the point so I can enjoy 1080p movies NOW and have the high seed download speeds of the 720p movies.\n\nTo be honest I wouldnt mine 1080p 4GB files over the 720p 264&amp;#039;s\n\n\nThanks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c420b3ecaae7eb65bc75926df224b6ff893d9a0a","amp;dn":"Teenage+Mutant+Ninja+Turtles+1-3+%281.44+x+3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c420b3ecaae7eb65bc75926df224b6ff893d9a0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,32,179,236,170,231,235,101,188,117,146,109,242,36,182,255,137,61,154,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
