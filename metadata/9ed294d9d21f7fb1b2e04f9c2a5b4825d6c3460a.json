While writing his last book, he travels from Los Angeles to New York to spend one night in the evil room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel, which is permanently unavailable for guests. The reluctant manager Mr. Gerald Olin objects to his request and offers an upgrade, expensive booze and finally the reports relating the death of more than fifty guests along decades in the cursed room. However, Mike threatens Mr. Oiln, promising to sue the hotel, and finally checks in the room. Along the night, he finds that guests of room 1408 can check out when they like, but they can never leave the room alive. \n\nDirector:        Mikael HÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¥fstrÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¶m\n\nCountry:         USA\n\nTransfer Format: 1080p \n\nYear:            2007\n\nRunning Time:    112 min\n\nIMDB:           &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0450385/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0450385/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFinalcodec Player \n\ndownload                                                                     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.siluhd.com/soft/FinalCodecs2008sp.exe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.siluhd.com/soft/FinalCodecs2008sp.exe&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou need a powerfull computer to play VC-1 codec HD\nRecommended: INTEL Core2 DUO or AMD X2 4800+ and ATI 2400 PRO\n\nOther movies visit                                                                          \n\n               &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/accpt7506_siluer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/accpt7506_siluer&lt;/a&gt;\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ed294d9d21f7fb1b2e04f9c2a5b4825d6c3460a","amp;dn":"1408.Director%5C%27s.Cut+.HD-DVD.REMUX.VC1.1080P.DTS-H","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ed294d9d21f7fb1b2e04f9c2a5b4825d6c3460a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,210,148,217,210,31,127,177,178,224,79,156,42,91,72,37,214,195,70,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
