If this is wrong to do, then tell me.)\n\nNOWADAYS UPDATE: I meant to say something other than just what I did, but I didn't, so here goes.\n\nThis song was edited to not bring up violence against police officers and such, even though there was [F] Tha Police by NWA before. I dunno. I hope 50 does a better record on Before I Self Destruct, which is his last required record with his label, other than a Greatest Hits CD. So enjoy this song, didn't need to really zip this, sorry, and have a nice day/night. :)\n\nUL by djteka","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96e393ff899748f5ffd551ba4b6efa1bb61c561d","amp;dn":"50+Cent+-+Officer+Down+%7C+Man+Down+from+Curtis+%28Uncensored+320k%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96e393ff899748f5ffd551ba4b6efa1bb61c561d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,227,147,255,137,151,72,245,255,213,81,186,75,110,250,27,182,28,86,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
