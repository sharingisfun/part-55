It was built on Python 2.5, which, if you don&amp;#039;t have it, can be downloaded for free at python.org/download\n\nThe Linux build will need glibc 2.3.6 or later.  You can get it here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.icewalkers.com/Linux/Software/512820/glibc.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.icewalkers.com/Linux/Software/512820/glibc.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you&amp;#039;re new to Blender, you might want to follow this link to see what it&amp;#039;s capable of:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.blender.org/features-gallery/gallery/images/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.blender.org/features-gallery/gallery/images/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAnd then you&amp;#039;ll want to follow this link to learn how to use it:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Manual/Your_First_Animation_in_30_plus_30_Minutes_Part_I&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Manual/Your_First_Animation_in_30_plus_30_Minutes_Part_I&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBlender is, as always, completely free and open source.  Enjoy!\n\nSince both Linux systems and FreeBSD are (sadly) relatively unknown in this world, they&amp;#039;ve been put together to combine the seeding power of both the Linux communities and the FreeBSD communities.  Most modern bittorrent clients allow you to prioritize files, so you place emphasis on the download of one file over others.  This will allow you to download the build you need faster, and still help the rest of swarm.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aee9950c2439ed3afdc0ebb103ee72b3f2fc7ac2","amp;dn":"Blender+2.46+Final+Release+for+Linux+and+FreeBSD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aee9950c2439ed3afdc0ebb103ee72b3f2fc7ac2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,233,149,12,36,57,237,58,253,192,235,177,3,238,114,179,242,252,122,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
