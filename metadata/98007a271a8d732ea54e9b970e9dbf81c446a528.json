This film was made mostly thanks to the effort of millions of citizens who donated their video recordings of the election to Luis Mandoki. Most of them are people supporting LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³pez Obrador.\n\nMillions of people worked together and shared hundreds of hours in filmed material to build this documentary; fake president CalderÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n is still, after one year of his administration, trying to overcome political differences arguing he works for the sake of people, even when this priceless (historical) movie exposes how he stole the presidency.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98007a271a8d732ea54e9b970e9dbf81c446a528","amp;dn":"Luis+Mandoki+-+Fraude+Mexico+2006.iso.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98007a271a8d732ea54e9b970e9dbf81c446a528","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,0,122,39,26,141,115,46,165,78,155,151,14,157,191,129,196,70,165,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
