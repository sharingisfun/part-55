It regained its soul later, metamorphosized into what it is now.  but there were some soulless years.\n\nHot Streets is the worst of those 3 transition albums.  If you&amp;#039;ve never heard of Donnie Dacus, there&amp;#039;s a reason why -- he sucks.  But he was the new blood the band brough in along with new producer Phil Ramone.  Completists need this album and there are a couple of kewl tunes.  But really, try to forget this album and swallow it as a pill of necessity to get to later ones.\n\n\n\nAlive Again\n\nThe Greatest Love\n\nLittle Miss Lovin&amp;#039;\n\nHot Streets\n\nTake a Chance\n\nGone Long Gone\n\nAin&amp;#039;t It Time\n\nLove Was New\n\nNo Tell Lover\n\nShow Me the Way\n\nLove Was New (Alternative version)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b0b2825ec9e7fd4b56f0038f45fd9ff756a6b9a","amp;dn":"Chicago+XII+--+Hot+Streets+%2812%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b0b2825ec9e7fd4b56f0038f45fd9ff756a6b9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,11,40,37,236,158,127,212,181,111,0,56,244,95,217,255,117,106,107,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
