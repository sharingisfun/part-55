Avoid fish-like enemies, conveyer belts, spikes, watery pits, time travel and more. The deeper in to this dream-like game players venture, the more challenging the solutions and the greater the time pressure becomes. Along the way, look out for shortcuts and secret exits and unlock bonus levels.\r\n\r\nIt is the elasticity of Kawase-chanâ€™s rubber fishing line that has set this apart from all other rope games, giving unprecedented levels of mobility and discovery. Tightening the line or giving lots of slack can be the difference between success and failure. The bungee like nature of the fishing line allows the player to stretch down to otherwise unreachable areas or be catapulted upwards.\r\n\r\nKey Features:\r\n\r\n    First time ever to be released overseas!\r\n\r\n    Total of 3 'UmiharaKawase Shun' are in 1 package; UmiharaKawase Shun, UmiharaKawase Shun Second Edition, and UmiharaKawase Shun Second Edition Kanzenban!\r\n\r\n    The latest version of this classic 20-year old franchise\r\n\r\n    Created by programmer Kiyoshi Sakai (also programmer on â€˜The Mosquitoâ€™) and character designer &amp; illustrator, Toshinobu Kondo â€“ creators of the original game.\r\n\r\n    Global time ranking","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e83db7b7cf200692957ce988fc62341626204b1","amp;dn":"UmiharaKawase+Shun+Steam+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e83db7b7cf200692957ce988fc62341626204b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,131,219,123,124,242,0,105,41,87,206,152,143,198,35,65,98,98,4,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
