After the comparatively lighthearted, irresistibly catchy opening single, &quot;Last Dollar (Fly Away),&quot; most of the midtempo material that follows ranges from the somber to the morose. There&amp;#039;s the night-shift weariness of &quot;I&amp;#039;m Workin&amp;#039;,&quot; the alcohol-drenched heartbreak of &quot;Whiskey and You,&quot; and the soul-tortured title track. Even a song with the upbeat title &quot;Put Your Lovin&amp;#039; on Me&quot; has McGraw asking his lover to &quot;be my drug&quot; and &quot;take this weight off me.&quot; Things turn positively lethal with &quot;Between the River and Me,&quot; the story of revenge on an alcoholic, wife-beating stepfather. The set also features the obligatory duet of marital devotion with Faith Hill (&quot;I Need You&quot;) and a couple of nods toward classic country (&quot;Kristofferson&quot; and the closing &quot;Shotgun Rider,&quot; which could be McGraw&amp;#039;s &quot;Mamas, Don&amp;#039;t Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys&quot;). &quot;Nothin&amp;#039; to Die For&quot; returns to the inspirational vein of &quot;Live Like You Were Dying,&quot; but little here finds McGraw in a feel-good mode.\n\n\nInformation Disc:\n\n?
