Every month \nthey spend countless hours configuring and updating their software. And yet every week millions of \nusers are infected by new threats that their traditional antivirus does not stop.\n\nWhy? Traditional antivirus solutions cannot protect you until after they&amp;#039;ve discovered a new threat \nand produced a signature to counter it.\n\nThreatFire is different. It does not rely on signatures, but instead constantly analyzes your computer&amp;#039;s \nbehavior to detect and block any malicious activity. ThreatFire protects immediately so you know your \nPC and your valuable data is always secure.\n\nInstallation:\nRun setup,then suspend and copy crack to dir.\n\n*_* Tryed And Scanned *_*\n\n* If Any Probs.PM me *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6215dea110a5930f6c5e0d09f7b36960da823af","amp;dn":"ThreatFire.Pro-maz%28v.3.0.14.16%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6215dea110a5930f6c5e0d09f7b36960da823af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,33,93,234,17,10,89,48,246,197,224,208,159,123,54,150,13,168,35,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
