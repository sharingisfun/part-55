Born in 1995, the band would eventually play gigs with some bigger name acts such as Stuck Mojo, New Bomb Turks and Turmoil among others. On Mercury Lift their 3rd album on the Century Media label, Haste does much to illuminate the darkened corners where aggressive music and thoughtful melodies conspire. 11 tracks. 2003. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe10aee2d8dc8f476c5e38ea2b442c6467995a48","amp;dn":"Haste+-+The+Mercury+Lift","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe10aee2d8dc8f476c5e38ea2b442c6467995a48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,16,174,226,216,220,143,71,108,94,56,234,43,68,44,100,103,153,90,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
