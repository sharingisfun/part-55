He owns a store and is a loanshark. He often sues people, and so his lawyer, Harry Seagraves, eventually meets Paris&amp;#039; wife Hannah. A former schoolteacher, she made the mistake of her life when she married Paris, who brutalizes her. Soon Paris goes beyond the overgenerous bounds of what a man in his position can get away with even in the segregated South, leading to a spiral of perverse insanity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a85a63bb7b18bd6b1a208c42f75ae11f488e308","amp;dn":"Paris+Trout+-+%5BDual+Esp-Eng%5D+-+DivXClasico.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a85a63bb7b18bd6b1a208c42f75ae11f488e308","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,133,166,59,183,177,139,214,177,162,8,196,47,117,174,17,244,136,227,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
