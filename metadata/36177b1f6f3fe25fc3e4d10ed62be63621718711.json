It works best with Toast:\nOpen Toast,\nSelect Copy,\nSelect &quot;Image File&quot;,\nSelect the image file---&gt;osx-leopard105.toast,\nInsert a DVD-DL,\nBurn the disc in the following name:\nMac OS X Install DVD.\n\nOnce it is done, ENJOY LEOPARD!\n\nNOTE: I have tried this. It installs very well, and has installed on five different machines: Macbook (4), and iMac Aluminum 20&quot;. The install may &quot;Freeze&quot; the first time, but second time is a charm :)\n\n\nCheers Boys!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36177b1f6f3fe25fc3e4d10ed62be63621718711","amp;dn":"Leopad+Bootable%2BBurnable%2C+10.5.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36177b1f6f3fe25fc3e4d10ed62be63621718711","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,23,123,31,111,63,226,95,195,228,209,14,214,43,230,54,33,113,135,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
