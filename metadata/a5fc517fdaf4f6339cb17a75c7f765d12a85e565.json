Wellman\nSCREENWRITER:           Ernest K. Gann (Novel: Ernest K. Gann)\nCOMPOSER:               Dimitri Tiomkin\nCINEMATOGRAPHER:        Archie Stout\nCAST:                   John Wayne, Claire Trevor, Laraine Day, Robert Stack, \n                        Jan Sterling, Phil Harris, Robert Newton, David Brian, \n                        Paul Kelly, Sidney Blackmer, Julie Bishop, John Howard,\n                        Wally Brown, William Campbell, John Qualen, Ann Doran, \n                        Regis Toomey, Paul Fix\nSTUDIO/PRODUCER:        Paramount Pictures\nGENRE:                  Action/Drama\n\n\nSYNOPSIS/PLOT:\n\n     John Wayne personally produced many of his &amp;#039;50s films, which is \nwhy some of them have languished in corporate limbo following his death. The \nHigh and the Mighty was one of his most popular vehicles (no pun intended). This \nlong, necessarily sedentary drama aboard an endangered airliner is a CinemaScope \nbridge between 1932&amp;#039;s Grand Hotel and 1970s disaster movies. Despite Wayne&amp;#039;s \niconic presence as a pilot--now copilot--who survived the plane crash that wiped \nout his family, it&amp;#039;s an ensemble movie with an impressive cast: Robert Stack \nsharing the cockpit, OscarÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® nominees Claire Trevor and Jan Sterling, Laraine \nDay, Robert Newton, Paul Kelly, John Qualen, Regis Toomey, the ubiquitous Paul \nFix, and director William A. Wellman&amp;#039;s good-luck character actor Douglas Fowley. \nDimitri Tiomkin&amp;#039;s score won the Oscar, though the fondly remembered theme song \nisn&amp;#039;t as prominent as you&amp;#039;d expect. Wings veteran William H. Clothier shot the \naerial footage. (from amazon.com)\n\n\n\n\nTRIVIA\n\n    * The lyrics to the famed title song are only heard at the very end, are \nsung by a large choral group, and are different than the familiar lyrics heard \nin the popular-song record releases of the time.\n\n    * Jan Sterling reportedly shaved her eyebrows for her role in the film and \nthey never grew back.\n\n    * John Wayne&amp;#039;s first film in CinemaScope.\n\n    * Producer John Wayne chose Robert Cummings as his co-star for the role of \nCaptain Sullivan. Director William A. Wellman, however, overrode his producer \nand chose Robert Stack for the part.\n\n    * Joan Crawford, Ida Lupino, Barbara Stanwyck, Ginger Rogers, and Dorothy \nMcGuire all turned down roles in this film.\n\n    * Spencer Tracy was originally cast as Dan Roman. He backed out of the film, \nhowever, after hearing several negative comments about how strict a \ndisciplinarian director William A. Wellman was.\n\n    * Average Shot Length (ASL) = 11 seconds\n\n    * The actual DC-4 aircraft used to film the passenger boarding and flying \nsequences was a former military surplus Douglas C-54A-10-DC built in 1944. When \nfilmed, the aircraft (then registered as N4726V) was being operated by \nTransocean Airlines for whom the film&amp;#039;s author, Ernest K. Gann, had flown these \nplanes over the Hawaii-California routes. Known as the &quot;The Argentine Queen,&quot; \nbefore being acquired by Transocean in 1953 it had been the personal aircraft of \nArgentine dictator Juan Domingo PerÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n. Ironically, a little more than a decade \nafter appearing in the film this aircraft and the nine persons on board were \nlost on March 28, 1964, when the plane was forced to ditch in the Pacific Ocean \nabout 700 miles west of San Francisco. The plane was about eight hours into a \ncharter flight from Honolulu to Los Angeles when the pilot reported a serious \nfire in engine #2. The Coast Guard searched for the aircraft for five days but \nno trace of it was ever found.\n\n    * Towards the end of the movie, when Robert Stack tells John Wayne to \nwhistle something (because he works better with music), the tune that John Wayne \nwhistles is, &quot;I&amp;#039;m a Ramblin&amp;#039; Wreck from Georgia Tech&quot;.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5fc517fdaf4f6339cb17a75c7f765d12a85e565","amp;dn":"The+High+And+The+Mighty+%28DVDRip+Dual%29+%5BRePoPo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5fc517fdaf4f6339cb17a75c7f765d12a85e565","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,252,81,127,218,244,246,51,156,177,122,117,199,247,101,209,42,133,229,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
