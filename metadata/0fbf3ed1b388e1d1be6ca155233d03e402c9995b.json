While fleeing from the Rulon Armada in a space\ncruiser, Questar ordered their STEP crystal into activation, in a desperate\nattempt to flee;the power of their STEP (Space-Time Energy Projection) crystal\nripped a hole in the fabric of time, sending them back through time and space to\nprehistoric Earth. Unaware that at the same moment as their time jump, a tractor\nbeam was attached from the Rulon\\'s flagship, which caused it to make the jump with\nthe Valorian ship. The evil emperor Krulos now plots to capture the STEP crystal,\nwith his own grotesque Rulon forces. Each side uses their own methods for\ncontrolling/making friends with the Dinosaurs, the Valorians with their telepathic\namulets, and the Rulons with their Brain Boxes. And so, the battle continues,\nin a new place and time.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNOTES\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSwedish audio source is VHS!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fbf3ed1b388e1d1be6ca155233d03e402c9995b","amp;dn":"Dino.Riders.S01E01.READ.NFO.DVDRip.EN.SE.x264-Tomtenizze","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fbf3ed1b388e1d1be6ca155233d03e402c9995b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,191,62,209,179,136,225,209,190,108,161,85,35,61,3,228,2,201,153,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
