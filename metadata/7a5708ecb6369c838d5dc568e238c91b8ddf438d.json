There was nothing over the outro.\n- There was no intro for &amp;#039;Breaking The Habit&amp;#039;.\n- Chester brought out a Canadian flag after &amp;#039;Points Of Authority&amp;#039; and hung it on Mike&amp;#039;s keyboard before &amp;#039;Numb&amp;#039;.\n- On the intro to &amp;#039;Pushing Me Away (Piano Version)&amp;#039;, the crowd started singing &amp;#039;O Canada&amp;#039; over Mike&amp;#039;s keyboard part, so the band stopped and restarted the song. Afterwards, Mike commented, &quot;That was like the remix&quot;.\n- Joe added a few Leroy Jenkins samples in the set, throwing one in right after the outro to &amp;#039;Points Of Authority&amp;#039;, another before &amp;#039;Leave Out All The Rest, and the last one on the outro to &amp;#039;Faint&amp;#039;. \n\nAn LPLive.net release.\nEnjoy.\nThanks to ManBearPig for the show.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a5708ecb6369c838d5dc568e238c91b8ddf438d","amp;dn":"Linkin+Park+-+London%2C+ON+-+02-23-2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a5708ecb6369c838d5dc568e238c91b8ddf438d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,87,8,236,182,54,156,131,141,93,197,104,226,56,201,27,141,223,67,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
