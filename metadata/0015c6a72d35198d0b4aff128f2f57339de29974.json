With the Stupidity Surplus reaching dangerously high levels all over England, Acme Carpets employee and undercover SpecOps investigator Next has her hands full trying to persuade her 16-year-old slacker son, Friday, to join the ChronoGuard, which deals with temporal stability; if Friday continues to sleep away his future, the end is nearÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½for everyone. To complicate matters, a malicious apprentice begins making classic works of literature into reality book shows (Pride and Prejudice becomes The Bennets), a ruthless corporation tries to turn the Bookworld into a tourist trap, and the Cheese Enforcement Agency tries to bust Next for smuggling killer curd. The fate of the world may lie in a Longfellow poem. Fans of satiric literary humor are in for a treat.

All rights reserved. \n\nFrom Bookmarks Magazine\nSet in a world where books are more fun than television, more serious than the CIA, and more important than proper diet and exercise, the Thursday Next novels continue to grow in popularity-which is a good sign. In the fifth novel of the series (after Something Rotten, ***1/2 Nov/Dec 2004), Jasper Fforde again shows off his delicious British wit (and occasionally heavy-handed use of puns) in another zany romp. If you\\\\\\&amp;#039;re already a fan, First Among Sequels is sure to thrill. If you\\\\\\&amp;#039;re new to the series, you might as well dive right in. Either way, you\\\\\\&amp;#039;ll soon have a new appreciation of Henry Longfellow.\nCopyright ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2004 Phillips &amp; Nelson Media, Inc. \n\nFrom AudioFile\nAdult Harry Potter fans can find refuge in Jasper Ffordes Thursday Next series. Fforde brings to life the world inside books. Literary detective Ms. Next continues her work for Jurisfiction, the police force in the Bookworld. While she tries to persuade her slacker teenaged son to go to work for the ChronoGuard, who is responsible for temporal stability, she discovers that someone is turning literary works into reality TV shows and that others want to turn the Bookworld into a tourist trap. Emily Gray returns as narrator a second time, and her matter-of-fact delivery, especially regarding the National Stupidity Surplus, enhances the delightful lunacy of Ffordes tales. One annoying element to the presentation is a longer than usual lapse at the end of each track, which proves distracting. R.E.F.

Since the no-nonsense literary detective from Swindon made her debut, literature has never been quite the same. Neither have nursery rhymes, for that matter. With two successful books of the Nursery Crime series under his belt, Fforde takes up once again the brilliant adventures of his signature creation in the highly anticipated fifth installment of the Thursday Next series. And itÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½s better than ever. \n\nItÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½s been fourteen years since Thursday pegged out at the 1988 SuperHoop, and Friday is now a difficult sixteen year old. However, ThursdayÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½s got bigger problems. Sherlock Holmes is killed at the Rheinback Falls and his series is stopped in its tracks. And before this can be corrected, Miss Marple dies suddenly in a car accident, bringing her series to a close as well. When Thursday receives a death threat clearly intended for her written self, she realizes whatÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½s going onÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½there is a serial killer on the loose in the Bookworld.

Naturally, Thursday must travel to the outer limits of acceptable narrative possibilities to triumph against increasing odds. \n\nPacked with word play, bizarre and entertaining subplots, and old-fashioned suspense, ThursdayÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½s return is sure to be celebrated by JasperÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½s fanatical fans and the critics who have loved him since the beginning. \n\nAbout the Author\nJasper Fforde is the bestselling author of the Thursday Next series and the Nursery Crimes series.
