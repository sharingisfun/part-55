Sadly this is the ÃƒÂ¢??editedÃƒÂ¢?? version and not the full ten-minute live version, but even so, there is still more than enough here to satisfy. Those of you out there missing Faith No More and particularly their King For A Day era output, will hear plenty of similarities throughout, certainly in AtlasÃƒÂ¢??s use of chords and synth sounds.\nLyrically, this is nasty stuff and I am glad I am not at the receiving end of JohnÃƒÂ¢??s very subtle, yet equally vicious attack.\nThe end section is truly breathtaking stuff. The whole, tune breaking down to almost nothing before building on a slow, droning, hypnotic guitar and piano motif until it fades to nothing leaving me salivating for more (thatÃƒÂ¢??ll be the ten-minute version then!).\n\nThe almost ÃƒÂ¢??singleÃƒÂ¢??-like, ÃƒÂ¢??The StoryÃƒÂ¢?? rounds things off nicely and is perhaps the most straight-forward track on here. No bad thing, although it is clearly on their more ambitious musical ventures where Atlas excel. More please!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e962fb9687ebec0d438c5e0a00bfdd2936a7d70","amp;dn":"Atlas+-+Catatonic+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e962fb9687ebec0d438c5e0a00bfdd2936a7d70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,150,47,185,104,126,190,192,212,56,197,224,160,11,253,210,147,106,125,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
