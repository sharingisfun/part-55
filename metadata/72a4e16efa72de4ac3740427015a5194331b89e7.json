Despite initial criticism, Colon&amp;#039;s album El Malo has become known as one of the first albums to feature the &quot;New York Sound&quot; that sparked a renewed interest in Latin music during the 1970s.\nColon has been instrumental in the careers of such Latin musicians as Ruben Blades, who first sang with Colon&amp;#039;s band in 1975, and Celia Cruz, for whom Colon has produced such albums as Only They Could Have Done This Album in 1977 and the highly successful duet album Celia &amp; Willie in 1981.\nColon has also produced albums for Ismael Miranda, Sophy, Soledad Bravo, and the late Hector Lavoe, who sang with his band in the early &amp;#039;70s. Inspired by the music of various cultures, Colon has recorded with such musicians as Puerto Rican cuatro player Yomo Toro and David Byrne.\n\n\n\n\n1. Willie Colon - Americano Latino\n\n\n\n\n01.
