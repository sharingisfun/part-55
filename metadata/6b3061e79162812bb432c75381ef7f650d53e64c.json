Michael Straczynski. The show centers on the Babylon 5 space station: a focal point for politics, diplomacy, and conflict in the late 2250s and early 2260s. With its prominent use of pre-planned story arcs, the series was often described as a &quot;novel for television.&quot;\n\nThe five seasons of the series each correspond to one fictional sequential year in the period 2258-2262. As the series starts, the Babylon 5 station is welcoming ambassadors from various races in the galaxy. Earth has just barely survived an accidental war with the powerful Minbari, who, despite their superior technology, mysteriously surrendered at the brink of the destruction of the human race (the Battle of the Line).\n\nBabylon 5: The Lost Tales is an anthology show set in the Babylon 5 universe. It was announced by J. Michael Straczynski, creator of Babylon 5, at the San Diego Comic Con in July 2006. Straczynski has described the stories as ones he had for the Babylon 5 television series, but never had the time to produce. As of 13 August 2008, the project consists of one direct-to-DVD production containing two stories. On July 13, 2008, Straczynski announced he had no plans to further develop the series. Each story is worked around a single established character. The production uses cast members from the original television show. The show is shot in High-Definition Television with digital HD cameras. The visual effects are handled by Atmosphere Visual Effects, who previously have worked on other science fiction shows such as the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica and Stargate Atlantis. The music is composed by Christopher Franke, who also did the music for the original Babylon 5 series.\n\n\n--\n\nGetting all of Babylon 5, use those torrents:\n\nSeason 1: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170818/BABYLON_5_-_Season_1_DVDs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170818/BABYLON_5_-_Season_1_DVDs&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSeason 2: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170821/BABYLON_5_-_Season_2_DVDs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170821/BABYLON_5_-_Season_2_DVDs&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSeason 3: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170823/BABYLON_5_-_Season_3_DVDs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170823/BABYLON_5_-_Season_3_DVDs&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSeason 4: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170829/BABYLON_5_-_Season_4_DVDs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170829/BABYLON_5_-_Season_4_DVDs&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSeason 5: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170831/BABYLON_5_-_Season_5_DVDs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170831/BABYLON_5_-_Season_5_DVDs&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMovies: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170833/BABYLON_5_-_Movies_DVDs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170833/BABYLON_5_-_Movies_DVDs&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCrusade: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170835/BABYLON_5_-_Crusade_DVDs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170835/BABYLON_5_-_Crusade_DVDs&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Lost Tales: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170840/BABYLON_5_-_The_Lost_Tales_DVDs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170840/BABYLON_5_-_The_Lost_Tales_DVDs&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n--\n\n\nRecommended Watching Order:\n\n(1) The Gathering (Movie #1: Pilot Movie)\n(2) Season 1 - 5\n(3) The other movies\n(4) Crusade\n(5) The Lost Tales\n\n\n--\n\n\nMD5Sums for the ISOs:\n\nb01c3324c39c0de50c48471aa5fb03da  BABYLON5_LOSTTALES_DVDs/LOSTTALES01_VOICES_IN_THE_DARK.iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b3061e79162812bb432c75381ef7f650d53e64c","amp;dn":"BABYLON+5+-+The+Lost+Tales+DVDs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b3061e79162812bb432c75381ef7f650d53e64c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,48,97,231,145,98,129,43,180,50,199,83,129,239,127,101,13,83,230,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
