I&amp;#039;m well aware how the hacking scene thinks this paints an unfair portrait of hackers. Compared to what is usually painted, this doesn&amp;#039;t really paint them too bad. Compared to the really atrocious movie &quot;Hackers&quot;, this does a lot better at showing what hacking is really like. You don&amp;#039;t hack with a Mac, you hack from a PC in different ways. You get to also see the other try &amp; true techiques of Social Engineering &amp; Dumpster Diving. While any true hacker could point out the blatant lies in the movie (Mitnick &amp; Shimomura never met in person until after the arrest), it was cool that the film made some clear distinctions in terminology. If this movie showed actual hacking, it would of been a snoozer. This was able to keep it a bit more interesting without making it look cheesy to the semiliterate computer user. It&amp;#039;s funny how this won&amp;#039;t appear in the United States, maybe the US Government is afraid of the truth about how afterwards Mitnick was stripped of his constitutional rights. Watch this film, and be entertained, but don&amp;#039;t believe it, as most of it is really fiction.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d9688e559ad47a2868a21ad872dfc34237dfce9","amp;dn":"Hackers+2+-+Operation+Takedown","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d9688e559ad47a2868a21ad872dfc34237dfce9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,150,136,229,89,173,71,162,134,138,33,173,135,45,252,52,35,125,252,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
