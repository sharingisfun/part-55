Yep, a good move.\n\nsample at:\n\nQuality: 7\n\nImagine Lou Reed / Velvet Underground (circa White Light White Heat) crossed with Space Ritual-era Hawkwind. And vocals are replaced by plenty of spacey synth bits. That&amp;#039;s pretty much what F/i sound like.\n\n&quot;From Milwaukee, Wisconsin, has been around since 1981, releasing half a dozen LPs on RRRecords. The band started out as a unit elaborating on noise structures in the tradition of Throbbing Gristles &quot;Heathen Earth&quot; or Nurse With Wound&amp;#039;s &quot;Insect&quot; and &quot;Individual Silenced&quot;. F/i throbs like a stub toe. The band sounds like &quot;Space Ritual&quot;-era Hawkwind, Roxy Music circa &quot;For Your Pleasure&quot;, and Spaceman 3 at their best. Applied to this retro-art-psychedelic thing is the fine sonic landscaping of late &amp;#039;70s-early &amp;#039;80s industrial music.&quot;\n-Johan Kugelberg - New Revolutions - Details Magazine\n\nTrack six (threshold) has been given a post-Dime tidy-up, as there were several volume dropouts near the end.\n\nRichard Frenecki - guitar/processing/treatments\nBrian Wensing - guitar/space box\nTom Schnear - bass\nJan Schober - drums\nGrant Richter - electronics\n\n\n01. stop at the left 2:55\n02. 8:34\n03. from poppy with love 9:47\n04. 9:23//\n05. //15:27\n06. threshold 8:38 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13fb7943a6d23e1be014a9ea7383d64be0117911","amp;dn":"F%2Fi+-+Milwaukee+-+Sep+1989+-+Hawkwind+Heads+take+heed+%3A%29+++--FLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13fb7943a6d23e1be014a9ea7383d64be0117911","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,251,121,67,166,210,62,27,224,20,169,234,115,131,214,75,224,17,121,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
