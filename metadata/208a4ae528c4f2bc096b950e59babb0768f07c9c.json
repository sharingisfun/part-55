There are delicious Dickensian overtones throughout, and the look of the film itself is poetically potent. The entire mix is shockingly seductive with an unforgettable ending. Burton&amp;#039;s humor is part and parcel of his sheer brilliance, as always, and, as always, the great Johnny Depp is intense and positively unforgettable. All performances are electric, the pace and length are perfect, and the film draws us deeper and deeper with every moment into its stunning blend of the grotesque and the undeniably beautiful. Analysing the power of a film like this is no simple matter. The whole is dazzlingly disturbing. You don&amp;#039;t want to miss a second of it, even though the film is merciless to us and to its protagonists. It sings, it glows, it enchants, it horrifies. I want to see it again. And again. It&amp;#039;s a brutal and shattering masterpiece.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:208a4ae528c4f2bc096b950e59babb0768f07c9c","amp;dn":"Sweeney+Todd%3A+The+Demon+Barber+of+Fleet+Street+%282007%29+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"208a4ae528c4f2bc096b950e59babb0768f07c9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,138,74,229,40,196,242,188,9,107,149,14,89,186,187,7,104,240,124,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
