Pictures and more info can be found here- \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cinnamonpirate.com/blog/507/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cinnamonpirate.com/blog/507/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe game is in Chinese. Due to use of Mapper 163, you will need to use the NEStopia emulator to play this game. The game is also ridiculously HARD! First menu command is atack, second is Materia skills.\n\nI am bringing this to TPB as not only is this game exceedingly hard to find for download, but the few trackers that DO have copies are private trackers. You should not have to register somewhere to download these torrents, especially not an NES game.
