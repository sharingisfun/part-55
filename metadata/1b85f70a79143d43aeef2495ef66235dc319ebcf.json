For instance uTorrent shows that there's three(!) seeders on every torrent I upload when they've been published for a few minutes, and I have shared maybe 1% of the file. How's that possible? A month ago it showed &quot;only&quot; two..\n\nThe people who hate what I do block my listening port and slows down my bandwidth to an extreme low, and I'm being bombarded in comments on uploads and mails. The only thing I can do, is to appeal to you who are Christians, to help me seed these torrents, because I don't know how much longer I'm able to do this. Not for long, I fear. And I live in Norway, a so called &quot;free Nation&quot; of the western world..\nAnd then I'm accused of being a &quot;conspiracy-theorist&quot;.. :-)\n\nBut.. I am glad to be able to share this one with you. Listening to it may result in your heart actually feeling strange and wonderful things, and in wanting to become a better person.\nDon't let the title of the album scare you..\n\nIt's a live album from Larry. His voice and guitar, and his piano, and not much else.\nHe does some very nice songs here, and he seems to enjoy himself doing them. And why shouldn't he? He's was working for the greatest and best Boss in the universe..\n\nNow he finally rests in peace, on permanent vacation. The Firm Larry worked for has the best pension-plan ever; joy, peace, eternal life and much, much more.. :-)\n\nIn Memory of Larry Norman (1947-2008)\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d5a3b0a7bcb3bca7b0b8b4bcb995b2b8b4bcb9fbb6bab8&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b85f70a79143d43aeef2495ef66235dc319ebcf","amp;dn":"Larry+Norman+-+Children+Of+Sorrow+%5B1994%5D%40160","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b85f70a79143d43aeef2495ef66235dc319ebcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,133,247,10,121,20,61,67,174,239,36,149,239,102,35,93,195,25,235,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
