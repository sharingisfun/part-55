Beware of \nlarge, bloated internet security suites that consume hundreds of megabytes on your \nPC. These typically exist because vendors have acquired products and &amp;#039;bundled&amp;#039; them \ntogether. In contrast, ESET NOD32 was designed from the core as a single, highly-\noptimized engine that works as a unified Anti-Threat system to protect against a \nbroad spectrum of malware. Viruses, worms, spyware, and other malicious attacks, \nwhich are constantly evolving. ESET NOD32 utilizes patent-pending ThreatSenseÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ \nTechnology to detect tomorrow&amp;#039;s threats in real-time, by analyzing code execution \nfor malicious intent - keeping you ahead of the malware-writers.\n\nMinimal Performance Impact\nNOD32 conserves resources in memory and on disk, leaving more for your critical \napplications. The installer is just 11 MB and the application consumes an average 23 \nMB in memory (this fluctuates with changes to the detection technology). ThreatSense \nupdates, which include heuristics logic and signatures, are usually between 20 kB and\n 50 kB. Switch to NOD32 and be more productive.\n\nFastest Scanning\nGreat protection doesn&amp;#039;t have to slow down your computer. Written largely in \nassembly language, NOD32 continually wins awards for the fastest performance of any \nantivirus application, on average 3 to 34 times faster than the competition (source: \nVirus Bulletin). Switch to NOD32 and upgrade your computer&amp;#039;s performance.\n\nEasy to Manage\nProgram and database updates are automatically performed behind the scenes. If \nyou&amp;#039;re an individual or home office user you can just &amp;#039;install it and forget it.&amp;#039; \nBusinesses and organizations with large distributed networks can use the powerful \nRemote Administrator to centrally deploy, install, monitor and manage thousands of \nNOD32 workstations and servers. Get the best protection with the smallest footprint \nand fastest performance. NOD32 offers multiple layers of protection for your \norganization, at the desktop, file server and mail gateway. Find out which solution \nis best for you.\n\nProactive Real-Time Detection\nThe best security is proactive. Malware protection must be real-time at the point of \nimpact. Every minute one waits for a virus signature update creates a window of \nvulnerability that could have devastating consequences. ESET NOD32&amp;#039;s ThreatSenseÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ \nTechnology closes the window of vulnerability left open by other reactive , \nsignature-based responses.\n\t\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f90c7421b671d0b838851247bde953416937ff0a","amp;dn":"NOD32+Antivirus+3.0.650+%28with+unlimited+update+fix%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f90c7421b671d0b838851247bde953416937ff0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,12,116,33,182,113,208,184,56,133,18,71,189,233,83,65,105,55,255,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
