After sending maps to the device for the first time, it takes about 10 minutes of operation for Garmin to start displaying the maps, and from then on, it\ndoes not have a problem. This is because it requires some time to create indexes and borders for parts of the map you dont have.\n\nIf you get stuck somewhere, please post and i will help.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nBy Restrected.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3e4f9595cbb311146adaa102fe1efbc030b0587","amp;dn":"Garmin+XT+NA+most+Mobile+Phones+And+PDA+BlackJack+2+Tested","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3e4f9595cbb311146adaa102fe1efbc030b0587","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,228,249,89,92,187,49,17,70,173,170,16,47,225,239,188,3,11,5,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
