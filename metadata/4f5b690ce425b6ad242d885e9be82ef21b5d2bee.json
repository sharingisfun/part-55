Kate\\\\\\&amp;#039;s perfectionist nature is put to the test when she \\\\\\&quot;inherits\\\\\\&quot; her nine-year-old niece Zoe (Abigail Breslin), while contending with a brash new sous-chef who joins her staff. High-spirited and freewheeling, Nick Palmer (Aaron Eckhart) couldn\\\\\\&amp;#039;t be more different from Kate, yet the chemistry between them is undeniable. Rivalry becomes romance, but Kate will have to learn to express herself beyond the realm of her kitchen if she wants to connect with Zoe and find true happiness with Nick.\n\n\nAudio: English, french, spanish (with subtitles for each)\n\nvideo: Untouched NTSC 16:9 widescreen\n\nRipped: Everything except main 16:9 movie\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f5b690ce425b6ad242d885e9be82ef21b5d2bee","amp;dn":"No+Reservations","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f5b690ce425b6ad242d885e9be82ef21b5d2bee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,91,105,12,228,37,182,173,36,45,136,94,155,232,46,242,27,93,43,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
