I like the layout and simplicity of this older version over that of the newer more memory and cpu intensive incarnations.  And besides, it&amp;#039;s f***ing Scrabble.  Why would I need bird&amp;#039;s-eye-view, high def, CG camera pans inbetween moves?  The cool backgrounds and porno music is enough for me.\n\nNOTE:  432 errors are known to occur during installation with XP.  Disable all anti-virus software and/or install in safe-mode if this occurs.  Once executed for the first time, the program may also stall at an all black start-up screen while Windows firewall asks permission to unblock the program.  If this occurs, alt-tab out of the game, click accept on the window prompts and return to the Scrabble window.  Post here with any other problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0cceca4fef00c7eb0a9a016f4d7a79f3c6df4ce","amp;dn":"Srabble.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0cceca4fef00c7eb0a9a016f4d7a79f3c6df4ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,204,236,164,254,240,12,126,176,169,160,22,244,215,167,159,60,109,244,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
