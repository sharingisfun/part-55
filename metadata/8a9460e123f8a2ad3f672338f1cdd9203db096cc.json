It&amp;#039;s a way of building other worlds.&quot;\nJuan LÃƒÂ³pez Moctezuma quoted in THE MEXICAN CINEMA: INTERVIEWS WITH 13 DIRECTORS\n\nJuan LÃƒÂ³pez Moctezuma, although a man of varied interests, is chiefly known among genre film fans worldwide for his three 1970s horror films, all of which were released in English-language versions: La mansiÃƒÂ³n de la locura, Alucarda la hija de las tinieblas, and Mary, Mary, Bloody Mary.\n\nLÃƒÂ³pez Moctezuma, born in Mexico City in 1932, was the son of a judge, and his family originally wanted him to study law as well. However, the young man rebelled and eventually became involved in painting, the theatre, and radio/tv work. In 1959, he created &quot;Panorama de Jazz,&quot; a program on Radio UNAM that--although LÃƒÂ³pez Moctezuma left it after a few years--became an institution in Mexico and ran for more than 35 years. His last radio show ended in April 1995. LÃƒÂ³pez Moctezuma also worked in television for many years, mostly on &quot;cultural&quot; programs, and continued his stage career.\n\nWhile LÃƒÂ³pez Moctezuma--in an interview with Beatriz Reyes Nevares for the book The Mexican Cinema: Interviews with 13 Directors (1974)--said he had always been fascinated by movies, his introduction to filmmaking came when he made the short films &quot;Dios y libertad&quot; (aka &quot;Tierra de sombras&quot;), &quot;Blues por Silvia,&quot; and &quot;La mÃƒÂ¡quina de sumar.&quot; He also was a partner in a production company that made shorts. However, at the time (the 1960s) it was difficult to break into the Mexican film industry, and LÃƒÂ³pez Moctezuma went to work as an assistant to famous stage director Seki Sano. It was his theatrical work that led to his meeting with Alejandro Jodorowsky, a Chilean who was making a name as an avant-garde stage director in Mexico.\n\nLÃƒÂ³pez Moctezuma collaborated with Jodorowsky on Fando y Lis (1967), and received an associate producer credit on Jodorowsky&amp;#039;s famous cult film El Topo (1969). Like Jodorowsky, LÃƒÂ³pez Moctezuma worked in other fields besides cinema and his films would always be made on the fringes of the commercial film industry. His first feature was an Edgar Allan Poe adaptation, La mansiÃƒÂ³n de la locura. Although this picture was very different in style and tone from El Topo, there are a number of connections between the two films, including producer Roberto Viskin, cinematographer Rafael Corkidi, and a number of performers (including some of the actors who played the bandits in El Topo, who show up as escaped mental patients in La mansiÃƒÂ³n de la locura).\n\nLa mansiÃƒÂ³n de la locura was a critical success, winning prizes at film festivals in Italy, Yugoslavia, Switzerland, and France. However, because LÃƒÂ³pez Moctezuma was--again, like Jodorowsky--a true auteur, he did not find a position as a director of &quot;commercial&quot; feature films. &quot;I am fairly inflexible,&quot; he told Raquel Pequero in a 1994 interview (quoted in &quot;La Jornada&quot; on 4 August 1995), &quot;In the artistic field I think I am fairly tough because I have principles I cannot betray.&quot;\n\nAs a result, it was three years before shooting started on his next project, the Hollywood co-production Mary, Mary, Bloody Mary (April 1974). In August 1975 he began Alucarda, la hija de las tinieblas. Both of these movies have received fairly wide international distribution over the years due to their English-language availability and the exploitable subject matter.\n\nLÃƒÂ³pez Moctezuma did not make another film until late 1982. To Kill a Stranger was an &quot;international&quot; production starring Mexican singer/actress AngÃƒÂ©lica MarÃƒÂ­a (her husband at the time, RaÃƒÂºl Vale, was the producer), Donald Pleasance, and Dean Stockwell. Although To Kill a Stranger did receive some release, it is certainly one of LÃƒÂ³pez Moctezuma&amp;#039;s lesser efforts. Welcome MarÃƒÂ­a was even less successful. Financed by the son of actor Mario Moreno &quot;Cantinflas,&quot; the movie deals with the tribulations of a Mexican immigrant in the U.S.A., and received little or no release.\n\nAfter a number of years away from the screen, LÃƒÂ³pez Moctezuma initiated several projects in 1993. One, El alimento del miedo, was based on the actual case of a woman in the 1950s or &amp;#039;60s who was caught selling tamales containing human flesh! Yo el vampiro was made as a pilot for television, and apparently consists of three separate episodes of approximately 22 minutes each, based on &quot;classic&quot; horror stories by authors like Edgar Allan Poe. These movies were the last projects made at the AmÃƒÂ©rica studios (which subsequently closed and was sold to Azteca television), and have never been publicly screened.\n\nAfter a long illness, Juan LÃƒÂ³pez Moctezuma died of a heart attack on 2 August 1995. He was 63 years old. He is survived by two daughters, Alessandra and Joanna. \n\n\n\n###########################&lt;{0}&gt; Conspiratorrent &lt;{0}&gt;#############################","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a9460e123f8a2ad3f672338f1cdd9203db096cc","amp;dn":"Juan+Lopez+Moctezuma+%28Double+Feature%29_Alucarda+%26+the+Mansion+of+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a9460e123f8a2ad3f672338f1cdd9203db096cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,148,96,225,35,248,162,173,63,103,35,56,241,205,217,32,61,176,150,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
