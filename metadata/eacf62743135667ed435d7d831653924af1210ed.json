That is the life we are in. That is our reality. Buddha&amp;#039;s idea\nof liberation is based on these four. It tells you how people get\ninto it and how they can get out of it. In the Lankavatara sutra\nBuddha says,\n\n        Why are people running around and suffer so much? Because  \n        they don&amp;#039;t get emptiness straight, the nature of reality, what is\n        really going on. They don&amp;#039;t get the meaning of peace, [Skt.\n        nirvana] straight. That&amp;#039;s why they are circling, life after life.\n\nThat is very important. Life after life, we&amp;#039;re continuously doing the\nsame thing. We may think, &quot;Well, I am okay, I am not doing any-\nthing terrible and miserable&quot;. In one way it is true. We are greater\nthan many others. But on the other hand, we are not liberated, we\nare not free. That much we know.\n\n    For me the goal of spiritual practice, spiritual work, is that first\nwe have to liberate ourselves, then help liberate others. Liberate\nfrom what? From running around. The fear combined with confu-\nsion is traditionally called ignorance [Tib. marigpa], which might not be\nexactly ignorance as we understand it. This one beats us so badly. It\ntakes shelter in one of the emotions -- it can be hatred or obsession.\nWe are running around within that.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eacf62743135667ed435d7d831653924af1210ed","amp;dn":"GOM%3A+a+course+in+meditation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eacf62743135667ed435d7d831653924af1210ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,207,98,116,49,53,102,126,212,53,215,216,49,101,57,36,175,18,16,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
