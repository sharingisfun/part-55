The player\nobtains points in two ways: by rescuing children and bringing them to &quot;safe rooms&quot;\nlocated at both ends of each floor of the house, and by stabbing Michael with the \nknife (if it can be located). The player advances a level either by rescuing five\nchildren or stabbing Michael twice. The killer gets faster with each level \nincrease and the game continues until all of the player&amp;#039;s three lives are lost.\n\nThis game is similar to the concept of the original film, but unlike the film \nit has much blood and gore. For example, when the player is killed, their head \nis replaced with blood streaming out of the severed neck.\n\nEmulate With:\n\nstella-2.4\n\nInfo: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_%28video_game%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_%28video_game%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\nThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre [1983] [Atari]\n\nIn the game, the player takes on the role of the movie&amp;#039;s chainsaw-wielding villain,\nLeatherface, and attempts to murder trespassers while avoiding obstacles such as \nfences, wheelchairs, and cow skulls.\nEach victim slain gives the player 1,000 points. \nThe player receives additional fuel at every 5,000 points (5 victims). \nA life is lost when the player&amp;#039;s chainsaw runs out of gasoline. \nGameplay ends when the last tank of gas is consumed.\n\nEmulate With:\n\nstella-2.4\n\nInfo: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Chainsaw_Massacre_(video_game)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Chainsaw_Massacre_(video_game)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nA Nightmare On Elm Street  [1989] [Nes] \n\nNightmare on Elm Street pits a group of high school students against Freddy \nKrueger, who comes into their dreams and kills them in horrible ways. \nIn order to defeat him you must travel Elm Street in an effort to collect \nFreddy&amp;#039;s bones and destroy them forever (not) in the school&amp;#039;s furnace.\n\nEmulate With:\n\nNestopia\n\nInfo: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Nightmare_on_Elm_Street_%28video_game%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Nightmare_on_Elm_Street_%28video_game%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNightmare On Elm Street [1988] [ms-dos] \n\nThe DOS and Commodore 64 edition of a Nightmare on Elm Street was very different\nfrom the NES game of the same name.\nPublished by Monarch Development and developed by Westwood Studios the role \nplaying gameplay and overhead viewpoint were similar to Gauntlet games. \nUsing the characters from the third film, you can chose to play &quot;Kincaid&quot;, \n&quot;Kristen&quot;, &quot;Will&quot;, &quot;Nancy&quot; or &quot;Taryn&quot; on a quest to save &quot;Joey&quot; and defeat Freddy.\n\nEmulate With:\n\nDOSbox\n\nInfo: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Nightmare_on_Elm_Street_%28video_game%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Nightmare_on_Elm_Street_%28video_game%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFriday The 13th [1989] [NES]\n\nBased on the popular movie franchise, Friday the 13th casts you as one of six camp\ncounselors (three girls or three boys) at the infamous Camp Crystal Lake, and \nyou are tasked with destroying Jason Voorhees once and for all.\nTo get to Jason, you must run around a camp, killing zombie ghouls and collecting\nweapons, until you hear an alarm sound.
