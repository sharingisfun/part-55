It was exclusively sold at GameStop in North America, saw a very limited release, and was never too popular.  To be fair it&amp;#039;s a pretty unforgiving, unintuitive game.  The manual is a testament to this, as it basically contains its own walkthrough.  However, it is one of the weirdest games you will ever play, and many laughs are to be had as you go around trying to kiss everything and everyone you see.\n\nReleased late into the PS2&amp;#039;s lifespan, Chulip surprisingly came in CD format, meaning smaller filesize for you but less chance that a PS2 will recognize it.  Well, a legit copy anyway.  I don&amp;#039;t have a modded PS2 so I can&amp;#039;t tell you how this should be burnt, but if you&amp;#039;re reading this you should hopefully know what you&amp;#039;re doing already.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5cba95621ab8265a9f5d0e586b27f9cc919bae0","amp;dn":"Chulip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5cba95621ab8265a9f5d0e586b27f9cc919bae0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,203,169,86,33,171,130,101,169,245,208,229,134,178,127,156,201,25,186,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
