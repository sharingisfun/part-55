In the Great Kantou Desert, scattered humans eke out a living in the hot sand. Among them, a short-statured man they call \\&quot;Sunabouzu\\&quot; makes a living as a bounty hunter. Like a demon of the sand, he seems unbeatable. Yet, like all men, he has a particular weakness for the opposite sex...\n\nDisc Summary:\nWhen Desert Punk\\&amp;#039;s life is saved by an honest man, he is taught a valuable lesson in decency; a lesson he quickly forgets. But decency has no part in his next job, which is easily his crappiest task yet... literally.\n\nDisk Title: Desert Dung\n\n\nPast Releases are available from my site at www.drathor.fcpages.com\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31d6d4d9227799ebc33a6e453e094cd5b922435a","amp;dn":"Desert+Punk+%28Sunabouzu%29+Disc+%28DVD5+ISO%29+4+of+6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31d6d4d9227799ebc33a6e453e094cd5b922435a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,214,212,217,34,119,153,235,195,58,110,69,62,9,76,213,185,34,67,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
