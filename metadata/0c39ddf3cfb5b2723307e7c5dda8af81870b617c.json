Here&amp;#039;s a pretty rare artifact of the late 60s groupie musicians scene! Who&amp;#039;da thunk that the musicians of the bands were GROUPIES?! How does that work!? Paradox much? Anyway, this is an odd selection of wacked out conversations between groupies, demented ditties, and of course pedo-curious, (probably acid-and-x-induced!!!) &quot;love stories&quot; from The Girls Together Outrageously that was  brought into being by none other than Frank Zappa!!! He even played tambourine on this record. The group consisted of 5 groupies that collected around the Mothers/Zappa/LA Rock n Roll Scene from the late 60s and &quot;fronted&quot; by Miss Pamela Des Barres- Famous groupie and rock journalist! Many other pretty famous musicians were on here too. Including the likes of RY COODER, ROD STEWART, AND EVEN JEFF BECK!!!! Holy Hannah! So, I&amp;#039;ll let you guys judge this &quot;music&quot;!
