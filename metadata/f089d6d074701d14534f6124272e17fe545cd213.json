Their non compromising rock music and slightly feminist lyrics gave this band a huge success all over the world with their songs unfortunately its another band that still hasnt got all the credits they deserved. Loads and loads of people have heard their songs but dont know them. Still they will forever be remembered as one of the greatest rock bands in history. \n\nThis are all their official full length releases:\n\n1979 Pretenders\n1981 Pretenders II\n1982 Learning To Crawl\n1986 Get Close\n1987 The Singles\n1990 Packed!\n1994 Last Of The Independents\n1995 The Isle Of View\n1999 Viva el amor\n2000 Greatest Hits\n2002 Loose Screw\n2006 Pretenders Pirate Radio Boxset\n\nThe EP Extended Play from 1981 is not in here as a standalone mostly to save some place.
