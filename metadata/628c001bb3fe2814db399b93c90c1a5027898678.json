The purpose of this wizard is to make everyone can develop 2D MORPG very easy and very fast.\n\nThe target audience is mostly for 2D/3D Artist who wish to create a sample game for High Profile demo to display their art capability in an actual game. Also for Game Designer / Level Designer as a tool for Rapid Game Prototyping to show their talent on designing the game itself. And for game story writer, to create a good story directly within a game (or collaboration between all of them). Lastly ofcourse for everyone to create their own dream MORPG without thinking about how to program or how to draw animation.\n\nThe process for developing the game itself is very fast within seconds a MORPG can be played, NO programming NOR scripting involved at all, just mouse clicking. The interface itself is not very serious and scary, but fun and designed for common people minded. With a lot of video tutorial, FAQ Help and plenty of easy tools to use, everyone can contruct a game from ground up to a full blown serious Multiplayer Online RPG very fast. The online and multiplayer capability is automatic, no need additional effort.\n\nThe game produced is a feature complete RPG, may even be compared with current famous 2D MMORPG such as Ragnarok Online, Tales Weaver, Mapple Story, etc.\n\n- Frank Albert Pangajow -","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:628c001bb3fe2814db399b93c90c1a5027898678","amp;dn":"RPG+Studio+v1.0+-+Easiest+%26+Fastest+Creating+Online+RPG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"628c001bb3fe2814db399b93c90c1a5027898678","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,140,0,27,179,254,40,20,219,57,155,147,201,12,26,80,39,137,134,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
