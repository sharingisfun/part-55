Obviously inspired by MGM&amp;#039;s &quot;Thin Man&quot; series, this tele-film cast Hudson as San Francisco&amp;#039;s commissioner of police whose kooky wife, the always appealing Susan Saint James, sometimes made his cases more difficult through her unexpected involvement. Hudson was a truly gifted light comedian, and both the film and the series gave him a regular opportunity to demonstrate that talent in ways he had not been able to do since his successful pairing with Doris Day in &quot;Pillow Talk,&quot; &quot;Lover Come Back,&quot; and &quot;Send Me No Flowers&quot;. Susan Saint James (who had just ended a three season run as the &quot;girl Friday&quot; on &quot;The Name of the Game&quot;) was no Doris Day, but she complements him splendidly. Then there&amp;#039;s a fine supporting cast headed by John Schuck whose Sergeant Enright would continue as a regular in the series.\n\nThe story involves a theft at a charity auction and the disappearance of an Egyptian sarcophagus.\n\nStars: Rock Hudson (Stewart &amp;#039;Mac&amp;#039; McMillan), Susan Saint James (Sally McMillan), John Schuck (Sgt Charles Enright), Nancy Walker (Mildred)\nGuest star: Stacy Keach, Sr. (Dr. Hinton), Lilyan Chauvin (Mme. Jamac), James Wainwright (John Patterson), Herb Edelman (Gregory Constantine), Jonathan Harris (Mr. Wortzel), Kurt Kasznar (Edmond Corday), Rene Auberjonois (Andre Stryker), Jack Albertson (Chief Andy Yeakel)\n\nMcMillan and Wife 1x00 Once Upon a Dead Man.avi\nDVD&gt;DivX5/448x336/914Kbps/23.97fps\nmp3/102Kbps/48KHz/Stereo/95min/700Mb \n\nLeave a comment if you&amp;#039;d like to see more!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1141fb6adbd0f8106071609f0f8ddd0c55679692","amp;dn":"McMillan+and+Wife+1x00+Once+Upon+a+Dead+Man+%5Bretr%3Ftv%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1141fb6adbd0f8106071609f0f8ddd0c55679692","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,65,251,106,219,208,248,16,96,113,96,159,15,141,221,12,85,103,150,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
