In 1997 they decided to change Entwine&amp;#039;s musical style to gothic metal and rhythm guitarist and vocalist Panu Willman was shortly after added to the band&amp;#039;s line-up. In December of that year, Entwine recorded its first demo, entitled Divine Infinity. In February of 1998 female singer and keyboard player Riitta Heikkonen joined the band.\n\nThe band&amp;#039;s next album Gone was released in April of 2001. It received the award of &quot;Album of the Month&quot; from German magazine Hammer and the song &quot;New Dawn&quot; entered the &quot;Finnish Single Charts&quot; in one of the top ten positions.\n\n\n\n\nTRACK LISTING\nQUOTE\n1.
