The movie is exactly the length of a DV Tape and a sub-plot    \n is established by showing bits and pieces of video previously recorded on    \n the tape that is being recorded over. The movie starts as a monster of       \n unknown origin destroys a building. As they go to investigate, parts of the  \n building and the head of the Statue of Liberty come raining down. The movie  \n follows their adventure trying to escape and save a friend, a love interest  \n of the main character.                                                       \n                                                                              \n\n\n                           Happy Hacker Industries                            \nThis movie should play fine on most DVD/DivX Certified settop\ndvd players.
