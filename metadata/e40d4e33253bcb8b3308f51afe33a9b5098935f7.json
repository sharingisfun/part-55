They travel the country looking to buy and sell cars. Whether it's a \n   rare Shelby Mustang or a one-of-a-kind Bugatti, the key is buy low and     \n   sell high, something that doesn't always happen.                           \n                                                                              \n   Selling cars is a dangerous business... but perhaps there's no greater     \n   danger than negotiating with your own dad. Tom Souter, Jeff's dad,         \n   runs his own classic car dealership right around the corner from Jeff's    \n   shop in Lubbock, Texas.                                                    \n                                                                              \n   They are not just regular trading partners; they are trading partners      \n   hell-bent on one-upmanship. Tom says doing a deal with his son is like     \n   being locked in a closet with a porcupine, &quot;it's gonna hurt but you know   \n   it won't kill you.&quot;                                                        \n --\n  EPiSODE iNFO                                                              \n --\n   Series one, episode five - Hot Rods and Hot Models.                        \n                                                                              \n   Jeff, Meg and Perry travel to Las Vegas for an automotive trade show.      \n   Among their finds: a pristine 1965 Malibu; and two hot rods.
