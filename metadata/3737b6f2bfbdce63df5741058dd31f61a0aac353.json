First, was an interview with Lillian Diaz-Przybyl from the North American manga and comic company Tokyopop, and then we have Adam, our comic guy who runs Grey Haven Hobbies in White Rock, BC, Canada. We talk manga, gender and comics, the Iron Man movie, The Skrulls, Yaoi, and bunch of other stuff, so enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3737b6f2bfbdce63df5741058dd31f61a0aac353","amp;dn":"HiSciFi.May2-08.Skrulls%21+Iron+Man+%26+Tokyopop+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3737b6f2bfbdce63df5741058dd31f61a0aac353","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,55,182,242,191,189,206,99,223,87,65,5,141,211,31,97,160,170,195,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
