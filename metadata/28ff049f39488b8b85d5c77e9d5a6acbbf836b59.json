In her latest book, groundbreaking garden writer Carol Deppe (The Resilient Gardener,Breed Your Own Vegetable Varieties) focuses on some of the most popular home garden vegetablesâ€•tomatoes, green beans, peas, and leafy greensâ€•and through them illustrates the key principles and practices that gardeners need to know to successfully plant and grow just about any food crop.\r\nDeppeâ€™s work has long been inspired and informed by the philosophy and wisdom of Tao Te Ching, the 2,500-year-old work attributed to Chinese sage Lao Tzu and the most translated book in the world after the Bible. The Tao of Vegetable Gardening is organized into chapters that echo fundamental Taoist concepts: Balance, Flexibility, Honoring the Essential Nature (your own and that of your plants), Effortless Effort, Non-Doing, and even Non-Knowing. Yet the book also offers a wealth of specific and valuable garden advice on topics as diverse as:\r\nâ€¢    The Eat-All Greens Garden, a labor- and space-efficient way to provide all the greens a family can eat, freeze, and dryâ€•all on a tiny piece of land suitable for small-scale and urban gardeners.\r\nâ€¢    The growing problem of late blight and the future of heirloom tomatoesâ€•and what gardeners can do to avoid problems, and even create new resistant varieties.\r\nâ€¢    Establishing a Do-It-Yourself Seed Bank, including information on preparing seeds for long-term storage and how to â€œdehybridizeâ€ hybrids.\r\nâ€¢    Twenty-four good places to not plant a tree, and thirty-seven good reasons for not planting various vegetables.\r\nDesigned for gardeners of all levels, from beginners to experienced growers, The Tao of Vegetable Gardening provides a unique frame of reference: a window to the world of nature, in the garden and in ourselves.\r\n\r\n**PLEASE SEED**","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28ff049f39488b8b85d5c77e9d5a6acbbf836b59","amp;dn":"The+Tao+of+Vegetable+Gardening%3A+Cultivating+Tomatoes%2C+Greens%2C+Pe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28ff049f39488b8b85d5c77e9d5a6acbbf836b59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,255,4,159,57,72,139,139,133,213,199,126,157,90,106,203,191,131,107,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
