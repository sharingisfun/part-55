This is now corrected. The old torrent at http://thepiratebay.se/tor/4059575/Comedy_Spoken_Word_Performance_Art_Collection still works, but that file is screwed up. Sorry.\n--------\n\nBack in 1991, an amazing new label emerged for the production of spoken word albums, called the GANG OF SEVEN. Predictably, a lack of marketing money and the specialized nature of the genre led to its folding within a few years. Contained in this torrent are all the original GO7 albums, along with some additional later albums by the same and similar artists.\n\nBefore you skip this one as some high-falutin? artsy fartsy crapola (I won?t lie, there IS some of that in here), There is also some hysterically funny comedy, some pure art, and some great ideas that will leave you thinking. Have you ever had the pleasure of listening to a master story teller ply their trade? Spalding Gray?s monologues and Tom Bodett?s (yeah, the motel commercial guy) stories fit that mold. Rick Reynolds is a comedian that makes his true life the basis for his act, and it is unforgettably funny. Anyone who ever liked Jack Kerouac should try Hugh Brown Sh?, and the somber melancholy of Wallace Shawn (THIS is the same guy from Princess Bride???) is exquisite.\n\nIf you like Doug Stanhope, George Carlin, Mark Twain ? there is something here for you. Only the very limited, ignorant, or stupid will not enjoy most of this material. An absolute must for English majors or anyone with a profound love of the English Language. Fans of quality Rap will love this one, while hip-hop fans probably will not. American Idol fans need not apply.\n\n\nAndrei Codrescu - No Tacos For Saddam\nBarry Morrow -    Bill for Short\nChris Morris - \tBlue Jam\nDavid Byrne - \tMusic for the Knee Plays\nHugh Brown Sh? -  Bomb The Womb\nJulia Sweeney -\tGod Said Ha!\n                  Letting go of God\nKevin Kling - \tHome and Away\nLynda Barry - \tThe Lynda Barry Experience\nRick Reynolds -\tOnly the Truth is Funny \n                  All Grown Up ...
