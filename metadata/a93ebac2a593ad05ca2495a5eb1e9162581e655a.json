You were great!, 19 March 2001\n8/10 Author: artzau from Sacramento, CA\n\n&quot;...Aside from some good old studio stand-bys, like Benson Fong and Philip Ahn\n(A Korean usually cast as some other Asian), this film has few of the faces that\nhung around the screens of Hollywood. But, Lancaster teamed up with the lovely\nJoan Rice from the UK to give us a wonderful tale of adventure in the South Seas.\nThis time, it takes us to the Solomons to the islanders of Yap, who worship the\nstone Fei, spirits who reside in stone wheels cut and transported nearly a\nthousand miles. O&amp;#039;Keefe winds up becoming their king but with profit in mind.\nHe wants to exploit the copra market but the Yap Islanders won&amp;#039;t work. So, he\nhits on the plan to bring their Fei back and this is the beginning.... It is a\ncharming story with lots of action and Burt was at his best. But, those beautiful\ngreen eyes of Joan Rice were a delight as well. It&amp;#039;s too bad we saw so little of\nher afterwards. Also, there&amp;#039;s a lovely song from this film, based in part on\nRachmaninov&amp;#039;s rhapsody, called Sweet Emerald Isle.
