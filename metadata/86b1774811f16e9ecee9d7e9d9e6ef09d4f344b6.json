(Electronic Edition - PDF)\n\n\nThe essential publication and research tool for serious Bell Witch fans.  As its name implies, this book gives you the full account of the legend and the people who were involved -- from North Carolina to Tennessee and  Mississippi, and from the early 1800s to the 21st century!  The wealth of information contained in this informative book was gathered and researched over a period of 20+ years.  The book includes the detailed story, pictures, footnotes, discussion notes, charts, index and table of contents, various appendices, and biographical sketches of the real people involved.\n\nFrom the image of a lifeless body hanging from a tree, to the apparition of a pale-faced woman and three children in a field, ?Kate? was all-knowing, all-powerful, and the personification of evil. She helped children in danger and nursed John Bell?s wife when she was sick; however, her two missions were to destroy Elizabeth Bell?s engagement and to kill John Bell. She accomplished both. Generations later, many descendants of those who were involved are STILL reluctant to discuss the legend. And even today, unexplainable things happen on and near what was once the Bell farm.\n\nAfter more than two decades of exhaustive research, author Pat Fitzhugh for the first time shares everything - the legend of the Bell Witch, the history of the Bell family and Robertson County, common myths about the legend, biographies of those who figured prominently into the legend, and detailed discussions about the religious and supernatural theories he used in reaching his own conclusion about the origin, identity and purpose of the ?Bell Witch.? Backed by detailed footnotes, insightful endnotes, and explanatory charts, Fitzhugh sheds new light to this epic tale of terror on the early-American frontier in this 406-page literary work.\n\nFrom cover to cover, readers will delve into the chilling supernatural terror that befell the John Bell family and altered their lives forever.  Pat Fitzhugh brings the legend to life in the most comprehensive account written to date regarding what many believe to be the most terrifying phenomenon ever known to humankind.  Pleasant dreams.\n\n\n\nwhat the critics are saying . . .\n\nsouthern legends and folklore review - ?Well-researched, authoritative, and compelling.?\n\nthe memphis pages -  ?Mr. Fitzhugh doesn\\&amp;#039;t resort to hocus-pocus or speculation, but relates the facts much as a criminal investigator would view a current crime.\n\namazon.com customer review - ?Nothing more substantive has been written about the Bell Witch ...?\n\nbarnes and noble customer review - ?Pat Fitzhugh Pens the Definitive Bell Witch Book?This book is an excellent read and chock full of heretofore unknown facts surrounding the legendary haunting.?\n\nyahoo - ?The world\\&amp;#039;s most sought-after expert on the Bell Witch phenomenon shares it all in this well-written account of the legend ...?\n\n\nLOOK WHAT YOU GET!\n\n               -- Full Story, Past thru Present\n               -- NC, TN and MS Versions\n               -- Theories and Myths Explained\n               -- Photos of Historical Sites\n               -- Biographical Sketches\n               -- Historical Research\n               -- Index, Footnotes, and Endnotes\n               -- Lots More!\n\n\nBook No. 2\n\nOur Family Trouble - The Bell Witch\n\nby Richard Williams Bell (published 1846)\n\n78 pages. Reprint, 2001. (Electronic Edition - PDF)\n\n\nFirst appearing in an 1894 publication, this 1846 manuscript penned by John Bell\\&amp;#039;s son is believed to be the only written eyewitness account of the \\&quot;Bell Witch\\&quot; in existence.  The very descriptive period prose and spelling are maintained in this 2001 reprint by the Armand Press, which also contains an introduction by Bell Witch historian, Pat Fitzhugh.\n\nRichard Williams Bell remembered vividly the terrifying events that plagued his family?s home on Tennessee?s Red River during the early nineteenth century.  An uninvited entity took up residence in the fall of 1817 and commenced gnawing bedposts, slapping children, reading minds, and performing other sinister acts.  It manifested itself both day and night; it knew the Bible; it even knew what people on the other side of the world were doing.\n\nThe entity hurt people; it was evil; it was a maligned being, straight from the depths of hell. It often reminded the Bells and others of its agenda--to torment John Bell, father of Richard Williams Bell, to his grave--which ultimately made him the only man in history whose death was attributed to a supernatural entity.  Those terrifying and painful events at the beginning of the nineteenth century in rural Robertson County, Tennessee changed lives forever and have baffled researchers to this day.\n\nIn 1846, twenty-six years after the death of his father at the hands of the entity, Richard Williams Bell penned a manuscript containing his and his family?s eyewitness accounts of the horrific disturbances.  The manuscript, entitled ?Our Family Trouble,? is the only written eyewitness account of the so-called ?Bell Witch? phenomenon, which is the most baffling and authentic haunting the world has ever seen.\n\n\nBook No. 3\n\nWitchcraft in America\n\nPublished by UÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½XÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½L\n\n\\&quot;Includes timeline from prehistory, Gregory the Great\\&amp;#039;s condemnations, European and American witch-hunts, neo-paganism, right through to publication of Harry Potter series.
