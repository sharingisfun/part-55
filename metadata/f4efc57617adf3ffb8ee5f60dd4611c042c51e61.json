The combination of\n     Blank &amp; Jones and the enigmatic, iconic, tender\n     voiced Bernard Sumner - of Joy Division, New Order\n     and Electronic - is naturally a dream, as Sumner&amp;#039;s\n     fragile yet bouyant melancholia slips beautifully\n     into, and out of, blank and jones very own\n     electronic sense of the epic. Blank &amp; Jones\n     continue their relationship with Dusseldorf and\n     London&amp;#039;s Claudia Bruecken. As always she fits\n     perfectly into the Blank &amp; Jones human-machine\n     scheme of things, her dramatic voice and their\n     dramatic dynamic totally in psychic synchronicity.\n     Confirming their inspired eclectic taste and their\n     love for experimentation, Blank &amp; Jones also team\n     up with audacious New York electroerotica torch\n     singer Vanessa Daou, cult electro-pop classicists\n     Trademark and deviant German pop singer Bobo of\n     Bobo in White Wooden Houses (she appeared as the\n     angel on dark rock group Rammstein&amp;#039;s 1997 song\n     Engel.) ?The Logic of Pleasure? has itself been\n     mixed in collaboration with Bob Kraushaar, the Pet\n     Shop Boys engineer of choice for the past two\n     decades. As always Blank &amp; Jones discriminating,\n     open minded musical judgement is impeccable, and\n     they&amp;#039;re forever committed to looking into dark\n     eccentric corners, as well as the obvious lit up\n     pop places, for inspiration and surprising\n     potential partnerships. Further proof of their\n     ambition to radically merge sound and ideas, the\n     acoustic and the electronic - a recent performance\n     project at the Tonhalle Dusseldorf that combined\n     Blank &amp; Jones with the Robert Schumann Chamber\n     Orchestra conducted by Alexander Shelly.\n\n     As intercontinental men of mystery in the full\n     glare of publicity, as rave favourites and ambient\n     entrepreneurs, as bliss boys and trance gods, Blank\n     &amp; Jones, demonstrating their love of life and a\n     lust for sensation, have made a number of\n     contributions to the pioneering CafÃƒÂ© del Mar chill\n     out albums and also conceived their own acclaimed\n     series of beautifully produced chill out albums.\n     The Blank &amp; Jones Relax series - from edition one\n     to edition three - demonstrate that the unit know\n     as much about producing calm, dissolving,\n     reflective atmosphere as wiring up flash,\n     energising city music.\n\n     Meanwhile, their charged, transporting, intensely\n     jubilant Mix albums - from Volume 1 to Volume 3 -\n     showcase Blank &amp; Jones as being geniuses of trance,\n     serious masters at captivating international\n     hedonists dedicated to losing their mind and\n     finding their body, or losing their body and\n     finding their mind. As in demand remixers, they\n     have worked on tracks by Moby, Yello, Pet Shop Boys\n     The Killers, Chicane...\n\n     For the thrill of it, because of an addiction to\n     airports and airplanes, night time and pleasure,\n     Blank &amp; Jones travel the world relentlessly as if\n     intending one day to play shows simultaneously in\n     cities on five continents. They&amp;#039;re welcome as elite\n     technoromantic thrill giving specialists around the\n     world &amp;150; in the best nightclubs in the most\n     modern cities, bringing steam, heat, heart and beat\n     to major events such as Mayday, Nature One and Love\n     Parade. They&amp;#039;ve visited Russia, Poland, Canada,\n     Mexico, South America and the Netherlands.\n     Following their inspiring collaboration with Robert\n     Smith on The Cure classic A Forest they are\n     increasingly in demand in the USA, as well as\n     regularly treating fans closer to home in Germany\n     and the Netherlands.\n\n     A Blank &amp; Jones set is a unique live extravaganza,\n     a spellbinding presentation of Blank &amp; Jones music\n     mixed with carefully chosen non- Blank &amp; Jones\n     music in the free flowing context of a dj set. The\n     editing and mixing is done on the night for the\n     night, wherever they are in the world, so that each\n     performance is unique, a combination of recorded\n     sound and improvisation perfectly tailored for the\n     audience and the environment. Blank &amp; Jones never\n     betray their dj roots, but inventively combine\n     DJing with their increasing boldness and ambition\n     as an acclaimed electronic pop group in their own\n     right.\n\n     So now that their 9th album ?The Logic of Pleasure?\n     is to be released, the time has come to ask: who\n     is, what are Blank &amp; Jones? And the answer is, and\n     isn&amp;#039;t, that they are Piet Blank and Jaspa Jones,\n     with, in the studio, the production plus of Andy\n     Kaufhold: that they are a mobile, time traveling,\n     world conquering hybrid of production team, sonic\n     theorists, lifestyle organisers, post-real DJ&amp;#039;s,\n     musical dreamers, pleasure programmers, extreme\n     party planners, emotional technicians, mood\n     arrangers and audacious electro-explorers. ?The\n     Logic of Pleasure? is their most complete and\n     imaginative collection yet, the ultimate proof that\n     Blank &amp; Jones are majestic masters at arranging\n     pure listening pleasure.\n\n\n     www.blankandjones.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4efc57617adf3ffb8ee5f60dd4611c042c51e61","amp;dn":"Above_and_Beyond_-_Trance_Around_the_World_219_%28DI.FM%29_%28Incl_Wip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4efc57617adf3ffb8ee5f60dd4611c042c51e61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,239,197,118,23,173,243,255,184,238,95,96,221,70,17,192,66,197,30,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
