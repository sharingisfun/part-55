Unfortunately there were occasional breaks in the recording which always spoiled the fun.\n\nA few years ago a second recording of the show surfaced.  It was also incomplete, but the breaks were in different places, so .........\n\nThis torrent comprises a merge of the two recordings, producing a complete, seamless recording (except for the disk flip between Secret Agent and Assassins of Allah).  This complete version has been in circulation since it was produced, so may not be new to everyone, but I thought it important to describe its lineage.\n\n\nLineup:\nDave Brock\nAlan Davey\nRichard Chadwick\n\nTrackist:\n\nIntro/Right to Decide\nSeven by Seven\nThe Right Stuff\nOut of the Shadows\nSpace Dust\nSnake Dance\nMask of the Morning\nSecret Agent\nAssassins of Allah\nHeads\nTime We Left\nDon\\&amp;#039;t Understand\nDamnation Alley\nGolden Void\nLSD\nBlue Shift\nPsi Power\nMaster of the Universe\nWelcome\n\nEnjoy the show.\n\nsonicsavage","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f7c931b4463b208ec972557db166ba120c112d5","amp;dn":"Hawkwind+1992+Reading+19th+May+1992+320+kbps+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f7c931b4463b208ec972557db166ba120c112d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,124,147,27,68,99,178,8,236,151,37,87,219,22,107,161,32,193,18,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
