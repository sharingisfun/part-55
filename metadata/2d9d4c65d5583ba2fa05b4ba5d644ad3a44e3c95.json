By strange coincidence, Sandy is dating the sister of the Danzing Lady.\n\nStars: Paul Burke, Frank Overton, Chris Robinson\nGuest star: Juliet Mills (Helen), Edward Mulhare (Kurt Halland), Rhys Williams (Ian Conboy), Victoria Shaw (Patti Conboy)\nWriter: Carey Wilber\nDirector: Robert Douglas\n\nTV&gt;XviD/640x480/922Kbps/29.97fps/b&amp;w\nmp3/113Kbps/48KHz/Stereo/47min/348Mb\n\nThis is the end of season 2.
