The public outcry over the ?death? of a fictional character was unprecedented with some folks wearing black armbands as a sign of mourning. In 1901 Doyle relented and wrote what is considered to be the best of all the Holmes tales ?The Hound of the Baskervilles.? In the one hundred plus years since then no other detective story has been reproduced more times as a motion picture, a television program or a radio play, and now here in the 21st century Sherlock Holmes along with his friend and biographer Dr. John H. Watson will once again reach out from the gas lit streets of Victorian England to take you on a journey involving legends, romance and death. Sit back and enjoy this feature length full cast production, complete with music and sound effects; let your imagination see and hear Baker Street, the Great Grimpen Mire and the hound from hell. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcc3c1d95caf34806a4fd46b350b18ae260b55e5","amp;dn":"%5BRadio+Drama%5D+-+Sherlock+Holmes+-+The+Hound+of+the+Baskervilles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcc3c1d95caf34806a4fd46b350b18ae260b55e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,195,193,217,92,175,52,128,106,79,212,107,53,11,24,174,38,11,85,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
