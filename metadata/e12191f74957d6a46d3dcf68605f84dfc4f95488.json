The 2T&amp;#039;s bring you an exclusive interview with the Doctor&amp;#039;s Daughter herself, Georgia Moffett, as she discusses her time on Doctor Who, how much of a fan her son is of the show, and her recent work on the Spooks Code 9 TV series. \n\nThe boys also review the most recent episode, 4.7: The Unicorn and the Wasp, and there are a few competitions on the go too. The fandom corner fan trap competition is still running where you get to decide the name of the segment, as well as a new competition centered around the Ribos Operation.\n\nOpening story is on the announcement that Peter Moffett (no relation to Peter Davison&amp;#039;s Daughter Georgia Moffett) taking over for RTD and how the show can be better without Russell T. Davies and the mal-aligned gay agenda that people are tired of, etc.  \n\nAlso includes a review of The Unicorn and the Wasp.  \n\n\nExcellent episode!   \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e12191f74957d6a46d3dcf68605f84dfc4f95488","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+DWO+Whocast+71+Podcast+%2824+May+2008%29+-+Moffett","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e12191f74957d6a46d3dcf68605f84dfc4f95488","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,33,145,247,73,87,214,164,109,61,207,104,96,95,132,223,196,249,84,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
