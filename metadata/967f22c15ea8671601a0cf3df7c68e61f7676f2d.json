Columbia was pretty disappointed with Chicago&amp;#039;s performance in its last few albums.  Here&amp;#039;s why, their highest chart ratings:\n\nIX:  #1\nX:  #1\nXI:  #6\nHot Streets:  #12\n13:  #83\n14:  #71\n\nOwch.  Plus the only single from 13 reached a height of #83.  And 14 #56.\n\nBut there are some good things about this album.  It is pared back, not quite as Disco.  It is also the last Donnie Dacus album which is good -- because he sucks.  And Laudir, the Brazilian percussionist who jumps up and down playing the marimba took his funky name and hair back to South America.\n\nAltogether, this album isn&amp;#039;t bad.  It&amp;#039;s a necessary stepping stone and one that probably spurred the band to come back, on another label, with three successive knockouts.\n\nThis album contains:\n\n\nManipulation\n\nUpon Arrival\n\nSong for You\n\nWhere Did the Lovin Go\n\nBirthday Boy\n\nHold On\n\nOvernight Cafe\n\nThunder and Lightning\n\nI&amp;#039;d Rather Be Rich\n\nThe American Dream\n\nDoin&amp;#039; Business\n\nLive it Up\n\nSoldier of Fortune\n\n\n\nIf you listen carefully, you can hear the loons.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:967f22c15ea8671601a0cf3df7c68e61f7676f2d","amp;dn":"Chicago+XIV+%2814%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"967f22c15ea8671601a0cf3df7c68e61f7676f2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,127,34,193,94,168,103,22,1,160,207,61,247,198,142,97,247,103,111,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
