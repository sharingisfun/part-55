One day at his own art show at the shop, New York art dealer Rorey Wheeler (Lili Taylor) buys one of Pecker&amp;#039;s &quot;modern pictures&quot; and invites girlfriend Shelley (Christina Ricci), a laundromat worker, common thief/best friend Matt, parents Jimmy and Joyce (Mark Joy, Mary Kay Place) a struggling bartender/bar owner and bargain clothing store saleswoman, daughter Tina (Martha Plimpton) a hostess/bartender at a gay strip joint, their sugar-crazed young daughter Chrissy, and the family&amp;#039;s religious grandmother called &quot;Memama&quot;, a &quot;pit beef&quot; sandwich chef, to an art gallery in New York City. It is then that Pecker becomes an overnight art sensation nationwide. Unfortunately, serious problems arise back home. Many of the residents become appalled and embarrassed by his pictures, costing him a whole lot more than his friends. It&amp;#039;s up to Pecker to make things right with his Shelley and make the people see the good from bad in photography.\n\nEdward Furlong\t ... \tPecker\n\nChristina Ricci\t... \tShelley","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff6ff90a2d49f27b438819702244693bd5c0cf2c","amp;dn":"Pecker+DVDRIP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff6ff90a2d49f27b438819702244693bd5c0cf2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,111,249,10,45,73,242,123,67,136,25,112,34,68,105,59,213,192,207,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
