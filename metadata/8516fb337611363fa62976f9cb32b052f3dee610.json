This vital role is examined in a volume which provides information on all wars and major battles from 1661 onwards in which the cavalry played a decisive role. The text includes details of various types of cavalry and troops, the countries who maintained a cavalry, the tactics, strategies and ploys used in conflicts, and an index of cavalry markings and the flags of various armies. The book is illustrated with full colour drawings of horses, cavalrymen and equipment, including weapons of each period, flags and other markings","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8516fb337611363fa62976f9cb32b052f3dee610","amp;dn":"The+History+of+Cavalry.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8516fb337611363fa62976f9cb32b052f3dee610","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,22,251,51,118,17,54,63,166,41,118,249,203,50,176,82,243,222,230,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
