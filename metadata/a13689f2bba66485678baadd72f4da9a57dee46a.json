Originally as a double LP on Bizarre/Reprise (I think it was on tape too), and produced by Mr. Zappa. The demented musical musings contained herein were thought up and performed by Larry &quot;Wild Man&quot; Fischer, who is a certified paranoid-schizophrenic (hey! We have something in common!) was &quot;discovered&quot; by Frank Zappa while performing his freakishly insane ditties on a street corner and offered to sell him a song. Frank thought that Wild Man was a genius and made a record with him!!! They were pretty good friends for a while. I&amp;#039;ve heard that Wild Man threw a glass bottle at baby Moon-Unit! I don&amp;#039;t think they were friends after that. Anywho, I here is Wild Man in all his Wild Glory!
