What\\&amp;#039;s most impressive here, however, are not the individual \nspeculations, but the series\\&amp;#039; success in integrating such a wide range of disparate ideas \ninto an absolutely compelling prehistoric narrative, one that sheds considerable light on \nthe extraordinary inner workings of our amazingly resilient miracle planet.\n\nGeneral Info:\n\nAfter the dinosaurs disappeared, the land was dominated by giant ground birds such as Diatrima. \nContinental drift, which had once caused the supercontinents to form, now broke up the huge landmasses. \nMammals found an isolated niche for themselves in the Asian continent. Free from the attacks of giant \nbirds, mammals could safely evolve there. In time, large, predatory mammals like Hyenodont emerged. \nWhen global warming melted the ice that had covered the land bridge between Asia and North America, \na conflict erupted between Diatrima and Hyenodont. The winner was Hyenodont. It was the start of the \ngolden age for mammals. Primates still hid from their predators in treetops, where they developed \na unique ability ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?? stereoscopic vision. Now that they could measure the distance between things, \nthey could easily jump from branch to branch. As a result of global warming, trees grew higher \nand thick forests covered entire continents. Primates could live without going down to the ground, \nwhere dangerous predators roamed. Then, as Antarctica was torn apart from other continents and became \na world of ice and snow, it started cooling the entire Earth. Forests disappeared, and most of the \nprimates became extinct. Anthropoids developed a fovea, part of the eye responsible for sharp vision, \nwhich enabled them to survive by efficiently finding food. Stronger eyesight brought about a \nside effect ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?? the ability to communicate through facial expressions. This led to the formation of \na \\&quot;society\\&quot; among anthropoids.\n\n\nIMDB Link: http://imdb.com/title/tt0488317\n\nComplete name : DiscoveryHD - Miracle Planet Ep.5 - Survival of the Fittest HDTV \n1080i DD2.0\n\nFormat : MPEG-2 Transport\n\nFormat/Family : MPEG-2\n\nFile size : 5.55GiB\n\nPlayTime : 36mn 5s\n\nBit rate : 17.0 Mbps\n\nVideo: \n\nCodec : MPEG-2 Video\n\nCodec/Family : MPEG-V\n\nPlayTime : 36mn 5s\n\nBit rate mode : CBR\n\nBit rate : 16.0 Mbps\n\nNominal bit rate : 18.2 Mbps\n\nWidth : 1920 pixels\n\nHeight : 1080 pixels\n\nDisplay Aspect ratio : 16/9\n\nFrame rate : 29.970 fps\n\nAudio: \n\nCodec : AC3\n\nBit rate mode : CBR\n\nBit rate : 384 Kbps\n\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\n\nChannel positions : L R\n\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n\nFinalcodec Player download                                                                     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.siluhd.com/soft/FinalCodecs2008sp.exe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.siluhd.com/soft/FinalCodecs2008sp.exe&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou need a powerfull computer to play AVC codec HD\nRecommended: INTEL Core2 DUO or AMD X2 4800+ and ATI 2400 PRO\n\nOther movies visit                                                                          \n\n               &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/accpt7506_siluer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/accpt7506_siluer&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7884c9f502d2ac2b6e0a8a993eec6935104a6cd6","amp;dn":"IMAX+-+Great+North+and+Straight+Up+Helicopters+in+Action","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7884c9f502d2ac2b6e0a8a993eec6935104a6cd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,132,201,245,2,210,172,43,110,10,138,153,62,236,105,53,16,74,108,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
