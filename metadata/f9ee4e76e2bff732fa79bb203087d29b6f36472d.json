They have always flirted a bit with country/cowboy symbols in the past (&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Wanted Dead Or Alive&amp;#039;&amp;#039;, anybody?) but this time have got down and done the dirty on an album described as &amp;#039;a Bon Jovi record influenced by Nashville&amp;#039;.\n\nThere are tracks here that are disappointingly pedestrian, such as Summertime, which you just want to end as soon as it starts, but then comes &amp;#039;&amp;#039;We Got It Going On&amp;#039;&amp;#039;, a song stuffed full of classic Richie Sambora talkbox action, extended guitar solos, gravely vocals, name checks for Jon, and Richie, and the immortal line ?we?ll be bangin? and sangin? just like the Rolling Stones?.\n\n&amp;#039;&amp;#039;(You Want To) Make A Memory&amp;#039;&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;&amp;#039;Seat Next To You&amp;#039;&amp;#039; are definite lighter in the air moments, but &amp;#039;&amp;#039;Everybody?s Broken&amp;#039;&amp;#039; is a real stadium classic with lyrics like ?when you wonder why you?re breathing/know you?re not alone/it?s so hard to believe/when it?s easier to doubt?. You can almost hear Dolly Parton singing, sorry sangin?, the words.\n\nIf you?re a fan of Bon Jovi then there is nothing here that you won?t like. For others, it certainly won?t blow you away, but it won?t make your ears bleed either. However, if you?re after the likes of the classic 80s Slippery When Wet album, you won?t find it here. Think big guitars tempered with country stylings, lyrics of emotional turmoil and ordinary people striving for something better, and you?ll be about there.
