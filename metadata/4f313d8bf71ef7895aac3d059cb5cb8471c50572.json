As a result, please make sure the system is always connected to AC power supply during the process. \n\n  \n\nQ: Why some Acer applications are not supported after I upgrade my computer to Windows Vista?? \n\nWindows Vista is a brand-new operating system that brings us many innovative and powerful features. As a leading computer manufacturer, Acer always devotes itself to deliver new technologies to our customers. For some features that were delivered by Acer and now are replaceable by Windows built-in functions, Acer decides not to port them to support Windows Vista so that we can focus on more advanced technologies. Below is a summary of Acer applications that do not support upgrading to Windows Vista. \n\nApplication name \n New version reinstalled on Windows Vista?? \n \nAcer eRecovery Management \n No. The new version of Acer eRecovery Management, which is compatible with Windows Vista?, requires repartitioning your hard disc drive and thus will cause data loss. As a result, the Wizard will not re-install the new version of eRecovery on you computer under Windows Vista?. However, you will be able to find the similar features in the built-in Backup Utility of Windows Vista, including full system volume backup to a HDD or CD/DVD. \n \nAcer eAcoustics Management \n No. Windows Vista supports similar functions of eAcoustic, and therefore Acer will no longer provide this utility for Windows Vista. \n \nAcer ePresentation Management \n No. Windows Vista allows you to easily manage your external monitor settings via Mobility Center . As a result, we do not support any upgrade of Acer ePresentation Management.\n \nAcer ePower Management \n No for partial models. Due to an underlying architecture change of Windows Vista, Acer ePower Management for partial models are not able to be upgraded. However, you can easily manage your power settings via Mobility Center of Windows Vista? instead. \n \nAcer ePerformance Management \n No for notebook models. While optimizing your system performance, it also takes a few, although not too much, system resource monitoring your system memory utilization. Since Windows Vista provides similar resource management functionality, we will no longer provide this utility for Windows Vista on notebook models. \n \nAcer Arcade 3.x\nAcer eNet Management 1.x\nAcer eDataSecurity Management 1.x No. Due to an underlying architecture change of Windows Vista, these applications are not able to be upgraded. \n\n  \n\nQ: Why not backing up to a hard disk drive with Acer eRecovery Management is not recommended ? \n\nA: If you backup your system to a CD/DVD with Acer eRecovery Management, the CD/DVD will be bootable. In case your system crashes during Windows upgrade or you would like to rollback to WindowsÃ‚Â® XP after a successful upgrade, you will be able to boot your system with the CD/DVD and restore your system to the state right before the backup gets started. Otherwise, if you backup your system to another disc driver other than CD/DVD, you will have to restore your system to Windows XP   \n\nQ: There are at most three backup tools appearing on the Acer Upgrade Wizard. How should I choose from them? \n\nA: Each of the backup tools has its functional scope. For example, Acer eRecovery Management can backup and your whole system volume, whereas NTI Backup NOW! and Backup Utility for Windows can backup your individual data files and settings. I recommend you to use all of them to backup your system before upgrading it. At least, you are highly recommended to backup your full system volume to CD/DVD with Acer eRecovery Management.   \n\nQ: Does Backup Utility for Windows have any limitation? \n\nA: Yes. If you want to backup your files with Backup Utility for Windows to a FAT32 hard disc drive, there is a limitation of 4GB for each backup output file. That is, you have to separate your files into two or more groups and backup each group one by one, if the total size of the files you want to backup exceeds 4GB.   \n\nQ: Will Acer provide technical support for the Windows upgrade? \n\nA: Yes. If you need technical support during your Windows upgrade, you can visit http://global.acer.com/support/winvista/ or call our customer service center.   \n\nQ: Where can I find more information about Windows Vista? \n\nA: Here are some recommended resources about Windows Vista. \n\nl          Microsoft Windows Vista website at http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista\n\nl          AcerÃ‚Â¡Ã‚Â¦s Vista Zone at http://global.acer.com/support/winvista/ \n \n\n\n [/quote] ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f313d8bf71ef7895aac3d059cb5cb8471c50572","amp;dn":"Acer+OEM+Vista+Upgrade+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f313d8bf71ef7895aac3d059cb5cb8471c50572","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,49,61,139,247,30,247,137,90,172,61,5,156,181,203,132,113,197,5,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
