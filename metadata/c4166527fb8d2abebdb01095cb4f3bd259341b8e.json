For more information about this television series: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_(TV_series)\n\nCollection of all the individual season 1 episodes (1-13) television series \\&amp;#039;Chuck\\&amp;#039;. All episodes were taken from individual episode uploads already on TPB.\n\nSome episodes were zipped files. Any that were zipped I unzipped. Those that weren\\&amp;#039;t zipped before have been left as is.\n\nSome episodes have small problems with video/sound but nothing that makes them unwatchable. Same quality as the original uploads.\n\nI retained original filenames so you can reference them against their original uploads on TPB.\n\n++++++++++\n\nHaving trouble with video/sound?
