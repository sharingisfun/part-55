First they break down the technology to see how it works and then use their know-how to see how it could be used in a different, supersized way. Could bulletproof Kevlar protect an airliner from bombs? Could a car airbag be reinvented to stop a helicopter from sinking after ditching at sea? The Smash Lab team aims to find out.\n\nFilmed at their Crash Lab in California, the team puts their ambitious plans to the test and captures them from every camera angle imaginable. Smash Lab is a visual feast of fireballs, explosions, crashes, collapses, collisions and impacts, because sometimes destruction is good for you.\n\nEpisode Information   \n \nTitle:  Long Range Life Boat \nEpisode Number:  10 \nSeason:  1 \nSeason Episode #.:  10 \nOriginal Airdate:  Wednesday March 19th, 2008 \n \nEpisode Summary   \n \nThe team tests whether a long range plane can drop a rescue raft for stranded sailors at sea using torpedo technology. \n \nSource: http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/smash-lab/about/about.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbb5855bdac195787e3df600e476c65f2c4dd7e0","amp;dn":"Smash.Lab.S01E10.Long.Range.Life.Boat.HDTV.XviD-K4RM4.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbb5855bdac195787e3df600e476c65f2c4dd7e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,181,133,91,218,193,149,120,126,61,246,0,228,118,198,95,44,77,215,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
