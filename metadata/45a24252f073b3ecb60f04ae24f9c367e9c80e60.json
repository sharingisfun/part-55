It is an adaptation of the semi-autobiographical novel of the same name by Akiyuki Nosaka, intended as a personal apology to the author&amp;#039;s own sister.\n\nSome critics?most notably Roger Ebert?consider it to be one of the most powerful anti-war movies ever made. Animation historian Ernest Rister compares the film to Steven Spielberg&amp;#039;s Schindler&amp;#039;s List and says, &quot;it is the most profoundly human animated film I&amp;#039;ve ever seen.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45a24252f073b3ecb60f04ae24f9c367e9c80e60","amp;dn":"%5BBikkuri%5D+Hotaru+no+Haka+%5BXvid+624+x+320%5D.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45a24252f073b3ecb60f04ae24f9c367e9c80e60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,162,66,82,240,115,179,236,182,15,4,174,36,249,195,103,233,200,14,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
