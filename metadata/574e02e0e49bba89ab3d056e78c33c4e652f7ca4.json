Honoring his authentic and lasting legacy of cowboy\nsongwriting, recording and performing, Capitol Nashville/EMI will release\nClassic Chris LeDoux, a new CD/DVD and digital collection of his top recordings\nand videos, on April 29. Among the 15 audio tracks and 15 videos on the new\ncollection are LeDoux's &quot;Bang A Drum&quot; with Jon Bon Jovi, &quot;Whatcha Gonna Do With\nA Cowboy&quot; with Garth Brooks, and the music video for &quot;Ridin' For A Fall,&quot; making\nits commercial release debut.\n\nA true cowboy, Chris LeDoux wasn't driven by the prospect of fame or money when\nhe began pursuing rodeo professionally, or when he starting writing and\nrecording his own music. In pursuit of the World Championship in Bareback Bronc\nriding, which he won in 1976, LeDoux spun his stories of life on the circuit\ninto fresh western anthems. Recorded in a true mom-and-pop shop, LeDoux sold his\nrecordings out of his pickup truck at competitions and quickly found a devoted\naudience and high praise for his bonfire ballads and lyrical candor.\n\nIn 1989, one of LeDoux's more famous fans stepped forward with an endorsement\nthat validated the rodeo champ as a true country music artist, bringing\nwidespread and mainstream attention to his music. Garth Brooks, in his early hit\n&quot;Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old),&quot; referred to playing &quot;a worn out tape\nof Chris LeDoux.&quot; That same year, LeDoux signed his own recording contract with\nCapitol Nashville.\n\nWith sales of his 36 albums totaling more than six million units in the U.S.,\none platinum and two gold album certifications from the RIAA, a Grammy\nnomination and the Academy of Country Music Pioneer Award, LeDoux's career flew\nhigh during his life and continues to resonate after his March 2005 death from a\nrare form of cancer at the age of 56.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:574e02e0e49bba89ab3d056e78c33c4e652f7ca4","amp;dn":"Chris+LeDoux+-+Classic+Chris+LeDoux+%5B2008%2FVBR197%5D-XXL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"574e02e0e49bba89ab3d056e78c33c4e652f7ca4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,78,2,224,228,155,186,137,171,61,5,110,120,195,60,78,101,47,124,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
