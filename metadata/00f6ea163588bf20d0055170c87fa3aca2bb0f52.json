Narrow streets, squares with an atmosphere of the Middle Ages, silence and calm. Or not: a young man formerly known for his honesty has recently been caught stealing treasures, and now some families have renewed wounds of past grievances. Family revenge? Black magic? Lost bet? Dishonest intrigue? \n\nIt is difficult to find out, since some of the characters have taken their secrets with them to the grave. However, the Professor is compelled to take part in the untangling of the entangled threads if he is to reach his goal, as an offspring of the family indicated on the granite plate has been arrested on the well-grounded suspicion of having stolen the treasures. \n\nA mysterious music box, an iron door in the church that has not been opened for a hundred years, an unfinished painting, some strange letters and of course the fourth manuscript from the John Gillam Codex are found. But will the Lost Sword of Toledo be found?\n\n\nInstall Notes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n1. Mount or Burn\n2. Install\n3.
