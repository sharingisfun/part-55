The vinyl was centralized which means there was absolutely no side to side movement of the tone arm. This is usually the major flaw with vinyl as it causes a &quot;WOWING&quot; effect noticable to most audiophiles. It is usually caused by the hole not being entirely central and is more annoying than the occasional click in my opinion. Also in use on the Dual 505 Record Deck was a Platter Pad (a solid rubber mat, about 1CM thick) which no user of vinyl should be without. It enhances the sound no end!\n\nPlease re-seed for other music lovers.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:569aaaf0f18b248a8ed29d05aa7ff95a03d0a133","amp;dn":"Smokie+-+Whose+Are+These+Boots+%5B1990%5D+HQ+VINYL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"569aaaf0f18b248a8ed29d05aa7ff95a03d0a133","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,154,170,240,241,139,36,138,142,210,157,5,170,127,249,90,3,208,161,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
