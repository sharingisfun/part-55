Friedrichstrasse\n\nDescription : \nFrigo is an electro-rock trio band based in Rennes (France). Evolving in an off-centre modern electropop, where nothing is really fixed as every track seems to be made of 5 other ones, Frigo studiously build a musical puzzle made of simplicity, efficiency and sobriety as shown by the artwork on the EP &amp; LP sleeves. The band makes ingenuity &amp; minimalism compete. Bright melodies, crystal-like guitar, hypnotic drums, outerspace keyboards + electronica, nearly-dark atmosphere &amp; strange voices give Frigo a unique sound, while some critics may still occasionally evoke somes influences, going from the ghostly eighties sounds of Joy Division, The Cure and Kraftwerk to more actual rock bands such as Radiohead, Trans Am, The Notwist and Boards of Canada.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8f69f94d2d8995c973fc547ae2c693400107f1f","amp;dn":"Frigo+-+Teleportation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8f69f94d2d8995c973fc547ae2c693400107f1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,246,159,148,210,216,153,92,151,63,197,71,174,44,105,52,0,16,127,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
