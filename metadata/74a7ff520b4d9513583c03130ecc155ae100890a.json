The war with the Colonies has ended, and there is revolution in \nFrance; the Royal Navy has cut back in size, putting a large number of officers \nout on the street, all begging the admiralty for some type of ship. Among these \nunfortunate souls is Richard Bolitho, who is given command of three small \nrevenue cutters. It is not long until we find Bolitho locking horns with a huge, \nand very vicious, smuggling ring, who also attempt to rescue the imprisoned King \nof France. As with his previous performances of Kent&amp;#039;s works, Michael Jayston is \na delight to the ear. His crisp voice easily moves from narrative to \nconversation and from character to character without missing a beat.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74a7ff520b4d9513583c03130ecc155ae100890a","amp;dn":"Alexander+Kent+-+With+All+Despatch+-+%288CDs+Unabr%29++-+read+by+Mic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74a7ff520b4d9513583c03130ecc155ae100890a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,167,255,82,11,77,149,19,88,60,3,19,14,204,21,90,225,0,137,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
