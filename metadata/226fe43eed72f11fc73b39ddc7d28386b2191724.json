Looking for something clean, fun and entertaining for the whole family, this movie will serve the purpose. It is by no means a riveting drama or a hilarious comedy. However, it will be fun for the kids and mildly entertaining for adults. Just by the tittle you should get the idea that the movie is not a serious one. The dog in this movie who talks and does karate is bent on helping a cop find the killer of his previous owner. The cop gets himself into all kinds of trouble as he struggles to produce evidence. Of course a minor plot is his relationship with a female cop who he infatuated with. The dog of course tries to help him with this as well. I guess you will have to watch to see how everything turns out. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:226fe43eed72f11fc73b39ddc7d28386b2191724","amp;dn":"Karate+Dog+2004+DVDRip+XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"226fe43eed72f11fc73b39ddc7d28386b2191724","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,111,228,62,237,114,241,31,199,59,57,221,199,210,131,134,178,25,23,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
