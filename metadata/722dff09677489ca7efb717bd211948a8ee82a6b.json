It was that classic XP feel, with an added touch of elegance. Only, I really disliked that ugly orange. I&amp;#039;m sorry to all of those energetic, bold people who love to wear orange, but I&amp;#039;m a bit more of a &amp;#039;chill&amp;#039; kind of guy. I like nice calm colours [Canadian spelling] that are soothing.\n\nThe Zune-Usmanistan Theme is like an extended version of the original MS Zune Theme. You can change that distasteful orange to many colours that I have chosen, under the &amp;#039;Colour Scheme&amp;#039; menu on the &amp;#039;Appearance&amp;#039; tab, in &amp;#039;Display Properties&amp;#039;.\n\nAdmittedly, I made this theme in about 5 minutes, using StyleBuilder which I just started using for the first time yesterday. And I&amp;#039;m sure there are some amazing computer graphic artists who are probably hysterically laughing at the &amp;#039;Download&amp;#039; button for my theme, as in comparison to their themes, is very primitive. But I think there will be some people out there who will really appreciate this theme.\n\nIt really does look nice!\n\nAnyhoo, I invite you to make any suggestions, comments, and the bluntest of criticisms, as without them I will have no reason to change the theme.\n\nWell, that&amp;#039;s it. Here is my first theme upload ever.\n\nEnjoy!\n\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:722dff09677489ca7efb717bd211948a8ee82a6b","amp;dn":"WAY+BETTER+VERSION+OF+ZUNE+THEME+-+Zune-Usmanistan+Theme","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"722dff09677489ca7efb717bd211948a8ee82a6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,45,255,9,103,116,137,202,126,251,113,123,210,17,148,138,142,232,42,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
