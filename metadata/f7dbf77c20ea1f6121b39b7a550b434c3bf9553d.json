This was uploaded to youtube, so I ripped it off and converted it to mp4 so you may put it on your Ipod if so inclined. Not taped by me. Quality is bad, but it is this bands first concert, and they are great. Note: the song \\&quot;They Say\\&quot; was apparently put in by the Filmer to enhance quality.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7dbf77c20ea1f6121b39b7a550b434c3bf9553d","amp;dn":"Scars+on+Broadway+April+11%2C+2008+Concert+rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7dbf77c20ea1f6121b39b7a550b434c3bf9553d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,219,247,124,32,234,31,97,33,179,155,122,85,11,67,76,59,249,85,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
