I would describe the genre as experimental indie/electronica but it has elements of lots of other things including chiptune, post rock, metal etc.\nIt contains the original EPTwo(which was 6 tracks)remastered, and 3 new tracks which are probably the best i&amp;#039;ve ever done:\n\nTunnel Physics: This took 80 hours in total to make. Its obscene.\nTheme for Something: Epic./\nPLUSS: 12 minutes of improvised noise recorded with a dictaphone and produced up to make a journey into obtuse dynamics.\n\n\nIt&amp;#039;s by far the best release ive ever done (its my 11th album) and it took 18 months to make. \n\nTracklisting:\n1. Tunnel Physics\n2. Autonomous Seashield\n3. Amanda\n4. Theme for Something\n5. The Movement of Dogs\n6. Inslider\n7. Lye Flatley\n8. PLUSS\n9. Takenology\n\nHope you like it and please seed!Tell your friends about this release too!\n\nIf you want to check out a few tracks first, visit:\n\nTech:\nI use Sonar 6 Producer Edition, Pro Tools and Muzys to make the tracks. Muzys i use to sequence MIDI, Pro Tools is used for audio manipulation, Sonar for recording audio and final mixing/mastering.\nMany elements are made from recording guitars and manipulating the audio to make it sound like something else entirely. I also record lots of sounds that things make and turning them into beats etc.\nThe only samples i use are one-shots for programming drums. All music is made from Virtual Instruments or real instruments.\nBeats are made using Battery or sometimes Hydrogen on linux.\n\n\nThis is Xihilisk&amp;#039;s album, I take no credit for this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6100b4300a5c0e56729ab37318c60a1adad3ff40","amp;dn":"Xihilisk+-+%5C%22EPTwo+Special+Edition%5C%22+DEMONOID+EXCLUSIVE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6100b4300a5c0e56729ab37318c60a1adad3ff40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,0,180,48,10,92,14,86,114,154,179,115,24,198,10,26,218,211,255,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
