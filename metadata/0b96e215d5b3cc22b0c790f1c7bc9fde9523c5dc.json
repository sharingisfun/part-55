As the game&amp;#039;s story\nhas it, splinter factions in Japan&amp;#039;s military have begun to lay waste to Tokyo by means of giant robotic war machines called &quot;bullets.&quot; As a member\nof an elite government strike force, you will take command of a bullet and confront the rebels.\nRobot Warlords is a strategy game at its core, and it will include two play modes: story mode and life mode. In the story mode, you&amp;#039;re made to play\nthrough a linear series of missions, through which the game&amp;#039;s narrative unfolds. Life mode is much more fluid--in it, you&amp;#039;ll be presented with missions,\nand you can choose whether or not you want to participate in them. Regardless of the play mode you go through, you&amp;#039;ll be able to customize your\nbullet&amp;#039;s arsenal. You can choose to equip it with long range, short range, or hand-to-hand weapons, all of which affect your bullet&amp;#039;s movement, speed,\nand power ratings. The mission maps will be grid-based, and they&amp;#039;ll be replete with buildings, vehicles, and other such obstacles.\n\nTryb gry: 1-2 player\nWykorzystuje: Stereo Surround, Memory Card, Dual Shock, Vibration\nWymagania wiekowe: 11+\nNo?nik: 1 CD\n\nSpakowane: 433 MB\nWypakowane: 696 MB\n\n===============================\n\nPO SCIAGNIECIU PROSZE O SEEDOWANIE !!!\n\n===============================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b96e215d5b3cc22b0c790f1c7bc9fde9523c5dc","amp;dn":"Robot+Warlords+%5BPS2%5D%5BENG%5D%5BPAL%5D%5BCD%5D%5B.mdf%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b96e215d5b3cc22b0c790f1c7bc9fde9523c5dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,150,226,21,213,179,204,34,176,199,144,241,199,188,159,222,149,35,197,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
