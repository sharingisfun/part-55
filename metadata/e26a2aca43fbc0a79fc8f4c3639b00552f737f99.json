Seasons in the Abyss, released in October 1990, was the first Slayer album to be released under Rubin&amp;#039;s new Def American label, as he parted ways with Def Jam owner Russell Simmons over creative differences. The album debuted at #44 on the Billboard 200,[15] and was certified gold in 1992.[16] The title track spawned Slayer&amp;#039;s second music video, which was filmed in front of the Giza pyramids in Egypt prior to the Gulf War.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e26a2aca43fbc0a79fc8f4c3639b00552f737f99","amp;dn":"Slayer+-+Seasons+In+The+Abyss","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e26a2aca43fbc0a79fc8f4c3639b00552f737f99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,106,42,202,67,251,192,167,159,200,244,195,99,155,0,85,47,115,127,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
