Astronomy Domine (Barrett) 7&amp;#039;17&quot;\n\nThis bootleg has been extracted using CDDAE 99. The audio extraction has been perfect, i.e. without any errors. This is a rare bootleg of the early Pink Floyd featuring Syd Barrett. Please note that the sound quality is extremely lofi. It&amp;#039;s more of a collectors item. The instruments are audible, but the voice is very unclear. I also included some artwork.\n\nI hope you enjoy it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8218121bae54db5d8728c6584ffc6cf8ce4745f6","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd-1969-09-13-Starclub%2CCopenhagen%2CDenmark","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8218121bae54db5d8728c6584ffc6cf8ce4745f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,24,18,27,174,84,219,93,135,40,198,88,79,252,108,248,206,71,69,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
