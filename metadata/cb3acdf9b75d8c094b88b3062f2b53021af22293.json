A deadly plague, known as the \\&quot;Reaper Virus,\\&quot; has broken out, killing hundreds of thousands in its wake. In desperation, the British Government evacuates as many survivors as it can out of the infected area, and then builds a wall, preventing the remainder from escaping. Thirty years later, with the wall still up and the victims all but forgotten, the virus breaks out again. The Government decides to send a crack team of operatives, led by Major Eden Sinclair, into the hot zone to investigate the possibility of a cure.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb3acdf9b75d8c094b88b3062f2b53021af22293","amp;dn":"Doomsday.2008.Swesub.DVDrip.Xvid-Rantone","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb3acdf9b75d8c094b88b3062f2b53021af22293","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,58,205,249,183,93,140,9,75,136,179,6,47,43,83,2,26,242,34,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
