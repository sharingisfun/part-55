The band&amp;#039;s name comes from the nickname of Jimmy Johnson and the initials of the other two members, Bill Berg and Billy Barber (Dick Oatts, a woodwind player, would join the group in 1984.) They are most notable for the 90&amp;#039;s theme song to the American soap opera All My Children and for making one of the first all-digital recordings in 1978 (though the prototype machine which was used was the only machine able to read the master tape.) The band, with Johnson&amp;#039;s pioneering five-string bass from Alembic, went on to create five critically acclaimed albums for DMP Records before signing with Warner Bros. Records.\n\nTrack Listing:\n1. Universe of Two\n2. Pagan\n3. All My Children\n4. Some Other Time\n5. New Snow\n6. According to Anthony\n7. Hopeland\n8. Boof and Swat\n9. Creeper\n10. Tru\n11.
