From the outset, the band established their trademark &quot;twin guitar&quot;&amp;#039; sound, whereby two guitars play different melodies creating polyphony. Malice Mizer&amp;#039;s sound during the Tetsu era was a mixture of rock, early 1980s goth, and strong classical influences. Their first official release was the song &quot;Speed of Desperate&quot; on the 1993 compilation Brain Trash. Before this, they had released a demo tape called Sans Logique which contained no vocals. Shortly after the release of Brain Trash, Gaz left the band to join Kneuklid Romance, while Kneuklid Romance&amp;#039;s drummer Kami in turn joined Malice Mizer. In 1994, the band released their first album, Memoire, on Mana&amp;#039;s newly founded independent record label Midi:Nette, and shortly after re-released it with an additional bonus track, &quot;Baroque&quot; under the title Memoire DX. Only days later, singer Tetsu left the band.\n\nThis torrent contains their first album, a few rare tracks from their early years, and a few pictures.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e15a89ec8b1e94b103484d71117de21109cba503","amp;dn":"Early+Malice+Mizer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e15a89ec8b1e94b103484d71117de21109cba503","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,90,137,236,139,30,148,177,3,72,77,113,17,125,226,17,9,203,165,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
