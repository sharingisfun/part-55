The two discs included in the set highlighted some of the best (and most readily available) live acts of Led Zeppelin, most of which has been included in this torrent. The creator of this torrent holds the opinion that this torrent is of a higher quality than the other rips which are available on the internet, not the least of which due to its sound quality and the near-completeness of the rip. This audio of this rip is in .mp3 format.\n\nThis torrent includes (in chronological order):\n01. Danmarks Radio (03-17-1969)\n02. Supershow (04-25-1969)\n03. Tous En ScÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ne (06-19-1969)\n04. Royal Albert Hall (01-09-1970)\n05. NBC Studio Press Conference (09-19-1970)\n06. ABC &amp;#039;Get To Know&amp;#039; Interview (02-27-1972)\n07. BBC2 &amp;#039;The Old Grey Whistle Test&amp;#039; Interview (01-12-1975)\n08. Earls Court (05-23+24+25-1975)\n09. Knebworth (08-04-1979)\n\nThe only acts and features of the set which have been excluded from this rip are: The promos, (of which the audio can be found elsewhere); the version of &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; from the second DVD, which is in fact a sploodge edit of footage from Sydney mixed with the audio from &quot;How The West Was Won&quot;; and the Madison Square Garden audio, which has been documented (in almost the same manner) in both releases of &quot;The Song Remains The Same.&quot;\n\nI&amp;#039;ve uploaded this a few times on a few different sites, yet the trackers have died each time. If there are any problems encountered downloading this torrent, please leave a comment so that I can attend to them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4527d15b66575220e76040d17da67ab2e1fafd7a","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4527d15b66575220e76040d17da67ab2e1fafd7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,39,209,91,102,87,82,32,231,96,64,209,125,166,122,178,225,250,253,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
