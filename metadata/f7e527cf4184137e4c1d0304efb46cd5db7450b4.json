All the world's military cannot stop him, no matter what they throw his way. Until, with the whole world watching, Kane surprises himself by flying up to catch someone the supervillain has thrown off a building. With no idea of the extent or magnitude of his powers, Kane has a long way to go before becoming the first superhero. He must stay one step ahead of both Richter and the rest of the world while he figures out how to take down his nemesis. Time is running out, though, and Richter will do whatever it takes to make sure that he's Earth's only superhuman. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Kirby Heyborne\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7e527cf4184137e4c1d0304efb46cd5db7450b4","amp;dn":"Logan+Rutherford+-+The+Second+Super+%28The+First+Superhero+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7e527cf4184137e4c1d0304efb46cd5db7450b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,229,39,207,65,132,19,126,76,29,3,4,239,180,108,213,219,116,80,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
