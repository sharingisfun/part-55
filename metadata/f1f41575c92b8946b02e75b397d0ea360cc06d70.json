Narrated by TRUMAN CAPOTE. In color. Emmy Award winning adaptation of Capote&amp;#039;s recollection of his youth in the rural South during the Depression. Living with a slightly dotty but loving &quot;cousin,&quot; Capote remembers back to when he was about 10 years old and it was suddenly decided that &quot;it was fruitcake weather.&quot; The task of baking 30 cakes for mostly far-away friends and the other rituals of Christmas time are painted with such loving and nostalgic strokes, this becomes a truly beautiful Christmas experience. The poverty of the 1930s fails to stop or even slow down a loving relationship at a loving time of the year. An Emmy Award well deserved! \n\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1f41575c92b8946b02e75b397d0ea360cc06d70","amp;dn":"Truman+Capote%5C%27s+A+Christmas+Memory.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1f41575c92b8946b02e75b397d0ea360cc06d70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,244,21,117,201,43,137,70,176,46,117,179,151,208,234,54,12,192,109,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
