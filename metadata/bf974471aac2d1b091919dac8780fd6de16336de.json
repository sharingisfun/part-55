Sata (ahci/RAID) and wdm drivers included. No MUI or Dotnet in this. Inside you will found bootable ISO with some tools inside, but most of tools in RUS; VistaDriveIcon (transparent name, isnt?) which will work only for 32-bit apps; usertwix64 package, whick contains some goodies thet you will need (no more ctfmon, for example - but goodie internat.exe included); and registry patch for correct SMP support on non-server mb&amp;#039;s. To burn CD&amp;#039;s i suggest Nero8micro - it really does without any bugs.\nGood Luck!\n\nPS: This is 64-bit win for truly 64-bit CPU&amp;#039;s, like AMD Athlon. Using it on Intel Core NOT give you any additional perfomance, but on Athlon it does up to 30% for 32-bit apps and up to 80% for 64-bit apps (Tested on MediaCoder v0.6.1).\nPPS: if you are using ASUS or Intel mb - TURN OFF your internal audiocodec!
