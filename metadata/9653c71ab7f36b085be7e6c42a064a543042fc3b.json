But when his quest leads to a bizarre town called The Unhappy Place, he is plunged into an odyssey of gruesome torture, graphic violence and relentless sexual depravity. This is the landmark movie that fans and critics still consider to be the strangest and most controversial Spaghetti Western ever made.\n\nA hallucinatory, violent and surreal tale of greed, corruption, perversion and beyond...\n\nPicture: 2.35:1 WS\nSound/subs: English or Italian with Enlish subs\nFormat: NTSC\nExtras:\n# Django, Tell! - Interviews with Co-Writer/Director Guilio Questi &amp; Tomas Milian\n# Theatrical Trailer\n# Poster &amp; Still Gallery \n\nEncoded with DVD-Shrink.\n\n--------------\n\nCheck my other uploads for more Arthouse, Sleaze, Italo-Westerns, Horror, Cannibals, Sexploitation soundtracks and other weird and cult cinema.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9653c71ab7f36b085be7e6c42a064a543042fc3b","amp;dn":"Django+Kill+-+Guilio+Questi+1967+%2F+DVDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9653c71ab7f36b085be7e6c42a064a543042fc3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,83,199,26,183,243,107,8,91,231,230,196,42,6,74,84,48,66,252,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
