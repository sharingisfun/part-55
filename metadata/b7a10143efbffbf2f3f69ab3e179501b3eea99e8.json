His organic, Hendrix-inspired sound made him a six-string sensation. In short order, he joined the &amp;#039;80s version of King Crimson and simultaneously embarked on a quirky solo career. Along the way, he&amp;#039;s also been successful as a producer and songwriter for other artists.\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7a10143efbffbf2f3f69ab3e179501b3eea99e8","amp;dn":"Adrian+Belew+-+Side+Four+%28Live%29+%5B2007%2FMP3%2F320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7a10143efbffbf2f3f69ab3e179501b3eea99e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,161,1,67,239,191,251,242,243,246,154,179,225,121,80,27,62,234,153,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
