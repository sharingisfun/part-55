Contrarly to popular belief, Schnitzler did not create the piece specifically for Mayhem: when Euronymous asked for an intro he just gave him a random piece of music he found in his archives, it became &quot;Silvester Anfang&quot;.\r\n\r\nOn some editions, &quot;(Weird) Manheim&quot; and &quot;Pure Fucking Armageddon&quot; are combined into one track.\r\n\r\nThe outro only appeared on the original demo tape, original LP and many bootlegs, it was unlisted on the cover. It could previously also be downloaded via the band's official website. The outro appears in a &quot;supermix&quot; on the LP - it runs faster than on the MC.\r\n\r\nThe original cassette tape is considered a demo by the band.\r\n\r\nRecording information:\r\n\r\nRecorded at Creative Studios in Kolbotn, Norway during February/March 1987. Co-produced by Mayhem.\r\n\r\nAll songs by Mayhem, except &quot;Silvester Anfang&quot;, composed and recorded by Conrad Schnitzer &amp; &quot;Witching Hour&quot; composed by Venom","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:304cc046532c004cd86fa4d3f686cdcd609d505d","amp;dn":"Mayhem+-+Deathcrush%28EP%29+%281987%29+%5Bre-+1993%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"304cc046532c004cd86fa4d3f686cdcd609d505d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,76,192,70,83,44,0,76,216,111,164,211,246,134,205,205,96,157,80,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
