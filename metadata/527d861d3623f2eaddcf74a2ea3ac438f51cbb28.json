A comedy it is not. Rather, it\\\\\\&amp;#039;s a darkly textured British drama with thriller elements that explores the idea of sex and power, while inducing a number of very visceral reactions along the way. The abundant gay themes are deftly handled. Endgame is not for everyone, but those who like things a bit bent and raw will want to tell their friends about it. ~ Buzz McClain, All Movie Guide ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:527d861d3623f2eaddcf74a2ea3ac438f51cbb28","amp;dn":"End_Game_DVDRIP_to_iPhone_MP4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"527d861d3623f2eaddcf74a2ea3ac438f51cbb28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,125,134,29,54,35,242,234,221,207,116,162,234,58,196,56,245,28,187,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
