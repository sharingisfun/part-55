Nuna can climb ladders and ropes, move heavy obstacles, and throw her bola at targets to solve puzzles. Fox can fit through small areas that Nuna can't reach, scramble up walls, and jump to great heights.\r\nBrave the harsh world of the Arctic â€” Run under, through, and atop the unstable structures of an abandoned coastal village. Explore the eerily quiet treetops of a mysterious, frozen forest. Brave the fierce winds of the eternal blizzard. Only with the aid of Helping Spirits will Nuna and Fox have any chance of survival in a land where survival seems impossible.\r\nUnlock fascinating video insights â€” Elders, storytellers, and other members of the Alaska Native community share stories and wisdom about their culture, values and the amazing Arctic world encountered by players in over 30 minutes of interviews.\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: 7 / 8 / 10 \r\nProcessor: Intel Core 2 Duo E4500 @ 2.2GHz or AMD Athlon 64 X2 5600+ @ 2.8 GHz \r\nMemory: 2 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: GeForce 240 GT or Radeon HD 6570 \r\nDirectX: Version 9.0c \r\nHard Drive: 3 GB available space \r\nAdditional Notes: Xbox 360 or equivalent gamepad required for local co-op \r\n\r\nRecommended system requirements - Windows: 7 / 8 / 10 \r\nProcessor: Intel Core 2 Quad Q9550 @ 2.8 GHz or AMD Phenom II X4 955 @ 3.2 GHz \r\nMemory: 4 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: GeForce GTX 650 Ti or Radeon HD 7790 \r\nDirectX: Version 9.0c \r\nHard Drive: 3 GB available space \r\nAdditional Notes: Xbox 360 controller or equivalent recommended","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9a3ac6eda7f90e6a54786bf3027733111faacb2","amp;dn":"Never+Alone+Arctic+Collection+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9a3ac6eda7f90e6a54786bf3027733111faacb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,163,172,110,218,127,144,230,165,71,134,191,48,39,115,49,17,250,172,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
