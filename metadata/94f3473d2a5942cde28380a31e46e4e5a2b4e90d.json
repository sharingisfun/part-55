We   \n          found that the signal recorded through a microphone from a   \n          speaker in a studio produces a much more natural sound. So   \n            we recorded the clean guitar sound through an AKG C414     \n           B-ULS from a Marshall Power Amp Model 9005 and the guitar   \n           distortion through a combination of an E.lectroVoice RE20   \n            and a Shure SM57 from a Marshall 1959SLP. You can also     \n           adjust our clean guitar sound so it suits the music genre   \n             you&amp;#039;re working with by adding your favorite amplifier     \n                                  simulator.                           \n                                                                       \n          Picking noises are recorded in multiple forms on all frets   \n                                 and strings.                          \n                                                                       \n           Picking noises made while playing a guitar is one of the    \n          most important characteristics that identify a live guitar   \n          recording. That is why we took great care in capturing many  \n            variations of picking noises. Adding these noises, with    \n           consideration to timing and picking style, will make your   \n            guitar tracks sound natural. When you use picking noise    \n           sampled from a different position of the fret board than    \n           the one you&amp;#039;re applying it to, the result is an unnatural   \n              sound because the noise will not harmonize with the      \n                        original note&amp;#039;s sustain sound.                 \n                                                                       \n              With our Les Paul Guitar sound library, you get an       \n           expansive number of picking noises to work with covering    \n          all frets, strings, and playing styles. We promise that you  \n           will have all of the samples needed to make truly natural   \n                  sounding guitar tracks at your fingertips.           \n\n    ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n    ??--???Ã‚Â°?????_|___:____?????????_|__????_._             _._?????Ã‚Â°???---?\n           ????????+????+??????Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â°???????????[ iNSTALL nOTES ]???????\n         ????   ???      ???       ?????+? ?+??*?         ?*??+?   ????\n\n                For Kontakt2 users:                                    \n                1.
