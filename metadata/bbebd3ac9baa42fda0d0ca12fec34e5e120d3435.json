Maya wants to know absolutely everything about how her parents met and fell in love. Will&amp;#039;s story begins in 1992, as a young, starry-eyed aspiring politician who moves to New York from Wisconsin in order to work on the Clinton campaign. For Maya, Will relives his past as a idealistic young man learning the ins and outs of big city politics, and recounts the history of his romantic relationships with three very different women. On the campaign, Will&amp;#039;s best buddy is Russell McCormack. They not only have similar political aspirations, they share the same type of girl problems, too. Will hopelessly attempts a &quot;PG&quot; version of his story for his daughter ad changes the names so Maya has to guess who he finally married. Is her mother Will&amp;#039;s college sweetheart, the dependable girl next-door Emily? Is she his longtime best friend and confidante, he apolitical April? Or is she the free-spirited but ambitious journalist? As Maya puts together the pieces of her dad&amp;#039;s romantic puzzle, she begins to understand that love is not so simple or easy. And as Will tells her his tale, Maya helps him to understand that it&amp;#039;s definitely never too late to go back...and maybe even possible to find a happy ending.\n\nFile Type : Avi\nGenre : Comedy | Drama | Romance\nSource : Dvd NTSC\nDuration : 1:51:41\nResolution : 624 x 266\nFrames/Sec : 23.976\nLanguage : English\nVideo Codec : Xvid\nCompression : Xvid\nQ.Frame : 0.225\nAverage Video Bitrate : 896\nAudio Codec : Mp3\nAverage Audio Bitrate : 128Kbps\nSubtitles : English / Japanese / Portugues / Thai / Korean / Indonesian / Chinease\n\n             Up&amp;#039;d By[/color]\n[IMG]http://i220.photobucket.com/albums/dd94/ItheplagueI/final666.gif[/IMG]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbebd3ac9baa42fda0d0ca12fec34e5e120d3435","amp;dn":"Definitely%2C+Maybe+%282008%29+%5Bh33t%5D+By+%7BNoir%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbebd3ac9baa42fda0d0ca12fec34e5e120d3435","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,235,211,172,155,170,66,253,160,208,202,18,254,195,78,94,18,13,52,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
