Police who responded to KurtzÃƒÂ¢??s 911 call deemed KurtzÃƒÂ¢??s art suspicious and called the FBI. Within hours the artist was detained as a suspected &quot;bioterrorist&quot; as dozens of federal agents in Hazmat suits sifted through his work and impounded his computers, manuscripts, books, his cat, and even his wifeÃƒÂ¢??s body. Today Kurtz and his long-time collaborator Dr. Robert Ferrell, Professor of Genetics at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health, await a trial date.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82b92002898d05c40027d1aa6fd12872ec49db8e","amp;dn":"Strange+Culture","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82b92002898d05c40027d1aa6fd12872ec49db8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,185,32,2,137,141,5,196,0,39,209,170,111,209,40,114,236,73,219,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
