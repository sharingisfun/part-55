The film chronicles the relationship between the minister, the Rev. L. William Youngdahl, his white Lutheran parishioners and black Lutheran parishioners in the community. Youngdahl was the son of a former governor of Minnesota and federal judge, Luther Youngdahl. The film includes a meeting between Youngdahl and a black barber named Ernie Chambers who tells the minister that his Jesus is &quot;contaminated.&quot; At one point another Omaha Lutheran minister, the Rev. Walter E. Rowoldt, of Luther Memorial Lutheran Church, states that &quot;This one lady said to me, pastor, she said, I want them to have everything I have, I want God to bless them as much as he blesses me, but, she says, pastor, I just can&amp;#039;t be in the same room with them, it just bothers me.&quot; Rev. Rowoldt and other ministers also discuss the concern that blacks moving into white neighborhoods will decrease property values.\n\n\nOriginally rejected by the three major networks for being too controversial, the entire production was commissioned and underwritten by a religious organization, Lutheran Film Associates. The fact that they pressed for the film&amp;#039;s release despite the harsh light it casts, makes its existence all the more remarkable. This classic cinema veritÃƒÂ© film from award-winning filmmaker Bill Jersey captures an all-white Lutheran Church in Omaha, Nebraska as their earnest pastor tries to get the congregation to reach out to their fellow black Lutherans only to find a well of resistance among his flock. The candid result is one of the most honest, accurate, and effective expose of the civil rights impasse ever filmed.\n\n\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
