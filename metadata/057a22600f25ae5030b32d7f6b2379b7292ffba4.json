(2004)\nLet's Go! Minisuka Police (2004) - Best episodes collection, DVD 2 of 10.\n\nStarring:\n\n????     Mie Nanamori\n?????   Rika Ikeda\n?????   Maika Ikemoto\n?????   Akane Kanazawa\n\n\nThis is the 2nd DVD from the 10-DVD Minisuka Police box set. It features the top three best episodes from the second batch of Minisuka Police, plus an extra.\n\nLanguage: Japanese, no subtitles\n\nBackground:\n\nThis is a sort of a late-night reality/gag TV show featuring models dressed in sexy police uniform, wearing short skirts (&quot;minisuka&quot; refers to &quot;miniskirt&quot;).\n\nThe models are assigned to do various tasks ranging from playing games to doing sexy poses to catching lizards -- anything that makes them accidentally expose their underwear. This is the ultimate upskirts show. (&quot;Upskirt&quot; is &quot;panchira&quot; (????) in Japanese).\n\nAs of this writing, there are 13 batches of Minisuka Police in all. The first batch was aired in 1996.\n\n\nSEASON vs. BATCH\n\nIn the README file of DVD 3, I called the series &quot;the third season&quot;. I realized that the term &quot;season&quot; is inaccurate. In Japanese terminology, DVD 3 contains the three best episodes of &quot;Sandaime Minisuka Police&quot; (3?????????). &quot;Sandaime&quot; literally means &quot;third generation&quot;, not &quot;third season&quot;. Seasons are yearly, but &quot;generations&quot; are not necessarily yearly. In fact, the second set (&quot;Nidaime&quot; 2??) of Minisuka Police episodes was aired in Japan from January to March 1997, while the third set (&quot;Sandaime&quot; 3??) was aired from April to June 1997, and the fourth set (&quot;Yondaime&quot; 4??) was aired from July 1997 to March 1998.\n\nSo when it comes to the Japanese usage of &quot;generation&quot;, the word &quot;batch&quot; is much closer in meaning than &quot;season&quot;, and it's also the shortest to type. Hence, from now on I'll use the word &quot;batch&quot; to refer to a set of episodes and also to the girls in that set as well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:057a22600f25ae5030b32d7f6b2379b7292ffba4","amp;dn":"Minisuka+Police+%282004%29+DVD+02+of+10+DVDRip+OGM+Japanese","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"057a22600f25ae5030b32d7f6b2379b7292ffba4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,122,34,96,15,37,174,80,48,179,45,127,107,35,121,183,41,47,251,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
