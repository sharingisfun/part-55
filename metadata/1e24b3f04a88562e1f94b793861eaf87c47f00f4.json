Contributors ranging from the spiritual leaders of religious terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah to former Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel, reveal how terrorist atrocities by both Jewish and Islamic extremists over the past three decades have transformed the battle for land in the Middle East into a Holy War which threatens to engulf the world.\n\nThe film begins with the simultaneous hijacking of four Western passenger airlines in Jordan in September 1970, and ends with the attack by Islamic radicals on the U.S. in September 2001\n\nActual footage of the events and interviews with many of the surviving terrorists provide a profound, multi-sided examination of the story of terrorism.\n\nDirected and written by Jon Blair and Daniel Korn.\nreference link: http://thebox.bz/forums.php?action=viewtopic&amp;topicid=9158 \n\nshunster\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e24b3f04a88562e1f94b793861eaf87c47f00f4","amp;dn":"The+Age+of+Terror+3%2F4+-+In+the+Name+of+God++2002++Discovery","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e24b3f04a88562e1f94b793861eaf87c47f00f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,36,179,240,74,136,86,46,31,148,183,147,134,30,175,135,196,127,0,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
