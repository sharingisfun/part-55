She has worked with Sarah McLachlan among other well-known artists. In 2004, the press also reported that Jorane would appear on a Halloween special of the television series ZeD to perform a &quot;witchy acid cello&quot;.\nShe has released five full-length albums. Her most recent album is Vers a soi (2007) and her first mostly in the English language is The You And The Now (2005). She is now working on a web project named &quot;Canvas or Canvass?&quot;.\n\n***Seed and if you like the album, please buy it***\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e571208012aa7dd2a1be470ee85084019725bc95","amp;dn":"Jorane+-+16mm+%282001%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e571208012aa7dd2a1be470ee85084019725bc95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,113,32,128,18,170,125,210,161,190,71,14,232,80,132,1,151,37,188,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
