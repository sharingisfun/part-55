Rebuilding after the death of longtime frontman Bob Hite, leader Fito put together a solid lineup and proceeded to tour and record. While the Heat would eventually become greater than ever, in this video they were obviously a band in transition - and yet they were still great. Videotaped somewhere around 1983, &quot;Boogie Assault&quot; blends live in-studio footage with fantasy sequences and does so awkwardly, but it still adds up to a very entertaining hour.\nThis was taken directly from a dvd and the quality was never great, but certainly good enough. All you Canned Heat fans should eat this up.\n\nI cannot keep seeding for long. All of my files will be kept up for a while until there are sufficient seeds to keep it alive and then they are gone from my system. So please seed and enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb51cdf266336cc74d9064e6bfa85789817174bd","amp;dn":"Canned+Heat%3A+Boogie+Assault","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb51cdf266336cc74d9064e6bfa85789817174bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,81,205,242,102,51,108,199,77,144,100,230,191,168,87,137,129,113,116,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
