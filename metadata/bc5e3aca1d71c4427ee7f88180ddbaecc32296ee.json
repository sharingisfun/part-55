For some reason this recording has not been heavily circulated, and is shrouded in mystery. We have no legitimate doubts as to the authenticity of this recording. It appears to be from a working set of demo tapes that were used as the actual blueprint for The Final Cut -the last album that Pink Floyd would release with Roger Waters in the lineup. In some places the difference between this and the actual release are subtle, and in other places, the differences are quite stark, changing the overall tone of some of the meanings inferred from the actual release. We won&amp;#039;t be listing all of the differences here, so you can enjoy your own personal exploration of this work in progress.\n\nFree Range Pigs is releasing this volume for it&amp;#039;s historical significance. While the sound quality is not &quot;disappointing&quot;, the recording does &quot;show it&amp;#039;s age&quot; in some places. We&amp;#039;re not exactly sure, but it sounds as though this was recorded in a professional studio, so it is very likely that somewhere in this big world, a sonically superior copy exists.\n\nDisc One: 40:04\n1.
