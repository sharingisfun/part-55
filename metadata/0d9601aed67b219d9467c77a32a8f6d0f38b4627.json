Introduction\n----------------------------------------------------\nOn May 5th, 2008, Trent Reznor released The Slip,\nNine Inch Nails 7th studio album, for free online.\nAs was the case with Trent&amp;#039;s previous online releases\nThe Slip was available in multiple formats including\na new format, 24-bit/96-KHz WAVE.\n\n24/96 (or 96/24 as it is also known) is higher than\nCD quality, but requires a special setup to play.\nConnecting a computer up to a good sound system can\nbe a bitch, but nearly every home theatre today has\na DVD Player and a lot of them have surround systems\nthat support 24/96 or higher resolution audio.\n\nThat&amp;#039;s where The Slip DVD-Audio comes in. DVD-Audio\nallows 24/96 quality music to be played back on a\nfairly standard home theatre setup. The only catch\nis you need a DVD-Audio player.\n\n\n02. Technical Information\n-----------------------------------------------------\nDVD-Audio Side\n\n44.1/16-bit Group\n    Original Files: The Slip FLAC\n    Converted using: dBpoweramp\n    Options: No DSP, use original source settings\n\n96/24-bit Group\n    Original Files: The Slip 24/96 WAV\n    No transcoding\n\nSlideshow\n    Created in The GIMP 2.2\n    Created using each individual tracks artwork\n\nMenus - 4:3 Version\n    Created using The GIMP 2.2\n    This version will display properly on 4:3 screens\n    Looks OK when stretched to 16:9\n    Preferred for older TV&amp;#039;s\n    \nMenus - 16:9 Version\n    Created using The GIMP 2.2\n    Native 16:9.

Questions\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nQ: What do I need to play The Slip DVD-Audio?\n\nA: DVD-Audio is not the same as DVD-Video; it&amp;#039;s\ndifferent specification, so the first thing you&amp;#039;ll \nneed is a DVD-Audio Player. Fortunately many high \nquality DVD players have native support for DVD-Audio.\nWhile working on the Slip DVD-Audio I tested my releases\nusing a $150 Panasonic DVD-F87 5-Disc DVD Player.\n\nDue to the Nazi-esque tactics of the music industry\nDVD-Audio players cannot output lossless sound over\nan unencrypted digital connection. So unless you&amp;#039;re\nusing an HDMI player with support for encrypting DVD-\nAudio with HDCP you&amp;#039;re going to be stuck using the\n6-ch output of your player to connect to the 6/channel\ninput on your pre-amp or home theatre. Nearly every\nquality play/receiver combination will be able to\nsupport this.\n\nPlease Note: The Slip DVD-Audio uses no copy-protection\nMAKE LEGAL COPIES OF THIS DISC\n\nQ: Why are their two different versions?\n\nA: Because DiscWelder, the DVD-Audio authouring application\nI used does not appear to support using multiple subpictures\nIn order to make the disc display correctly in both aspects\nyou require one subpicture for Pan and scan and another for\n16:9. DiscWelder seems to only support 4:3, so I had to cheat to get native 16:9. It&amp;#039;s entirely possible this is due to\nmy own ignorance of the application.\n\nAs for why I didn&amp;#039;t just do one 4:3 version? Because.\n\nQ: Is this legal?\nA: The Slip was released by Nine Inch Nails under the Creative\nCommons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 United\nStates license. That means anyone is free to make a derivative\nwork on the condition that they attribute the original artist\nand they release it under the same or similar license.\n\nWhile I did not alter the music in anyway I do believe that\nthe additional authouring of the disc, the creation of menus\nand such, constitutes an original work. As always if the\ncontent owners have an issue, please contact me.\n\nQ: Why doesn&amp;#039;t the DVD-Video side have DTS 96/24?\nA: Because the program required to encode DTS 96/24 is very\nexpensive and none of my friends in the Film/Music industries\nhad access to an encoder. If anyone would like to transcode\nthe 96/24 files to DTS for me I would be happy to add them to\nmy disc images.\n\n\n04. Personal Notes\n----------------------------------------------------\nI made this disc for two reasons: I love NIN and I want to\ngive back to the community. Trent Reznor has been extremely\ngood to us by giving away The Slip and licensing it under\nthe Creative Commons and it&amp;#039;s important that we give back.\n\nIf you enjoyed the Slip DVD-Audio and haven&amp;#039;t already gotten\nthe real album, please go download it, directly from NIN at &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://theslip.nin.com.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://theslip.nin.com.&lt;/a&gt; The more support Trent gets the\nbetter chance we have of more releases like this. I strongly\nencourage you to also buy the Album when it&amp;#039;s released.\nDownloads are great, but there&amp;#039;s just something special about\nholding an album in your hands.\n\nThank you Trent for this awesome opportunity. See you August\n5th.\n\n05. Legal\n---------------------------------------------------\nThis DVD-Audio Disc is a community release and is not in\nanyway directly affiliated with Nine Inch Nails.
