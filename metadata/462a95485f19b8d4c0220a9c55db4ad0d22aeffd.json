If you, like most gamers, find it annoying looking for and inserting the CD-ROM for your favorite game each time you play it, then Game Jackal Pro is for you.\n\nGame Jackal Enterprise\nGame Jackal Enterprise has become the gaming tool of choice for cybercafes! Cybercafe owners and managers stand arm in arm with the private gaming community when it comes to no CD gaming. \nProtection of their gaming investment, convenience of use and small hard drive footprint are cited as the main reasons for moving to the Game Jackal product. Given the growing popularity of Game Jackal Enterprise within the world-wide cybercafÃƒÂ© community it was inevitable that we would develop an Enterprise Edition of this great product. The Enterprise Edition of Game Jackal has all the features of the basic product plus some fantastic additions to enhance the manageability of a no CD gaming environment for cybercafÃƒÂ© owners. Enterprise Edition seemlessly integrates with other third-party launchers and cyber-cafÃƒÂ© applications such as SmartLaunch and CyberCafe Enterprise. \n\nVirtual Clone\nVirtual CloneDrive works and behaves just like a physical CD/DVD drive, however it exists only virtually. Image files generated with CloneDVD or CloneCD can be mounted onto a virtual drive from your hard-disk or from a network drive and used in the same manner as inserting them into a normal CD/DVD drive. \nProbably the best virtual drive software, Virtual CloneDrive allows you to enjoy the freedom of a virtual drive and is completely free. \n\nUse CRACK or patch or keygen or reg in each app folder to register each one.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:462a95485f19b8d4c0220a9c55db4ad0d22aeffd","amp;dn":"SlySoft+Suite+%5BHD+Support+%5DW%2FKey+Gen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"462a95485f19b8d4c0220a9c55db4ad0d22aeffd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,42,149,72,95,25,184,212,192,34,10,156,85,219,74,208,210,42,239,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
