Johansson plays guitar and sings, Johan Berglund is on bass, and the notorious Dan SwanÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ is on drums and keyboards.\n\nJohansson and Co. thrash through 10 songs which all feel well-played. ItÃƒÂ¢??s obvious that a lot of time has been put into the music and lyrics. It all sounds like what a great old-school Swedish-style metal album should sound like. Of course, SwanÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ produced, mixed, and mastered the album, and yet again the magician has done a magical production. That man just canÃƒÂ¢??t fail when heÃƒÂ¢??s in the producer chair; thereÃƒÂ¢??s no doubt that heÃƒÂ¢??s one of the best producers in Europe when it comes to metal and harder music.\n\nThereÃƒÂ¢??s nothing more to say about this debuting act; they have written a solid metal album with songs that last for several hours. The material is high-quality and itÃƒÂ¢??s neatly performed by excellent musicians. BREATH OF THE DEMIURG is a given purchase for any old-school metalhead.&quot; - Metal-Rules.com\n\n&quot;The ÃƒÂ¢??Breath of the DemiurgÃƒÂ¢?? moves in old school Scandinavian death paths taking inspiration by the early Entombed, Bolt Thrower and Satyricon. Even if I am a huge fun of melodic death and under every rock in Sweden you can find a band playing that genre, I can also appreciate sheer pounding when it comes from players like the ones we are talking about. Forget the melodies and the clean parts that other fellow countrymen deliver, this is death metal in a rhythmic continuity that knows no rest. This album is full of riffs that are repeated in an almost cut/paste fashion (check ÃƒÂ¢??The Primitive MachineryÃƒÂ¢?? for example) until your neck hurts. The tempo stays still, no cuts (well, just a fewÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦), no slower parts except from the closing song that is has a crawling and atmospheric guitar. Maybe this description sounds boring for some while others are already in headbanging position. Since you understand that ÃƒÂ¢??Breath of the DemiurgÃƒÂ¢?? is hellish death from Sweden like it used to be done almost 20 years ago, you know what you are going to face. The album was produced, mixed and mastered by Dan Swano at Unisound Studios and that is another trademark of the content of this release.\n    Don`t expect multidimentional music by DEMIURG, the names of the participants speak for themselves. They are all members of the Swedish brutal death team and that`s what they are here for. Since they are a team they frequently change the roster among them in search of the one that will make the difference. DEMIURG`s debut is a satisfying release for its purpose with a few great songs and some more mediocre ones.\n    More than average, less than excellent.&quot; - Metal-Invader.com\n\n&quot;DEMIURG is a new band but its members should be known to the Death Metal community already.\n\n \n\nOne could easily assume that Rogga and Dan SwanÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ are best friends as this is the second band theyÃƒÂ¢??ve initiated together, RIBSPREADER being the other. Rogga even did the vocals on an EDGE OF SANITY release, namely ÃƒÂ¢??Crimson II;ÃƒÂ¢?? at least thatÃƒÂ¢??s the official version, IÃƒÂ¢??ve heard rumours about Dan doing some, or all, of the growls himself. No doubt about the lisp clean vocals, neither of their friendship.\n\n \n\nRogga has a fantastic growl, hands down one of the best there is, and what he does on ÃƒÂ¢??Breath Of The DemiurgÃƒÂ¢?? may be his best performance yet. It could have something to do with his skilled companion beefing him up like utter hell but who gives a fuck? If you didnÃƒÂ¢??t know, Dan SwanÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ is a self-taught, amazingly skilled producer.\n\n \n\nJust like RIBSPREADER, DEMIURG thrives in the landscapes of old-school land. Yet the two sound distinguishable different. DEMIURG sounds a bit more modern and diverse but both bands use ÃƒÂ¢??heavy as elephant-ballsÃƒÂ¢?? riffs as its main ingredient. I like the dish.\n\n \n\nIf you ever get onto the thought that DEMIURG is anyway original or groundbreaking IÃƒÂ¢??m pretty sure the wheel still amazes you.\n\n \n\nBut, and this is very important, they fucking add to an already existing formula, they arenÃƒÂ¢??t simply rehashing it. Think of it as a self-tuned Volvo good for something like 250 kilometres per hour, one that previously became wobbly around 200. That, my friends, is the first time IÃƒÂ¢??ve ever used the word wobbly, I like it.\n\n \n\nHope you liked my review, ÃƒÂ¢??Breath Of The DemiurgÃƒÂ¢?? deserves your attention. Not undivided or anything, but you might like it as much as I do.&quot; - Metal-observer.com\n\n\n\nDemiurg\n\nBreath of the Demiurg - (2007)\n\n1. The Dreams Without End\n2. Flesh Festival\n3.
