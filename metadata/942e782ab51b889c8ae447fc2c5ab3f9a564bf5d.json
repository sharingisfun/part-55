Accused of the murder of a young boy, she was hunted down by vengeful townspeople who cut out her tongue and killed her. They buried her along with her &quot;children,&quot; a hand-made collection of vaudeville dolls. \nSince that time, Ravens Fair has been plagued by death. The ghastly dolls from Mary Shaw&amp;#039;s collection have gone missing from the grave and reappeared over the decades. In the dead of night--wherever they are glimpsed--families are found gruesomely murdered...with their tongues torn out. \nFar from the pall of their hometown, newlyweds Jamie (Ryan Kwanten) and Lisa Ashen thought they had established a fresh start. But when his wife is grotesquely killed, Jamie reluctantly returns to Ravens Fair for the funeral, intent on unraveling the mystery of her death. \nOnce reunited with his ill father (Bob Gunton) and his father&amp;#039;s new young bride (Amber Valletta), Jamie must dig into the town&amp;#039;s bloody past to find out who killed his wife and why. As he uncovers the legend of Mary Shaw, Jamie unlocks the story of her curse and the truth behind the song from his childhood: if you see her and scream, you will never speak again.
