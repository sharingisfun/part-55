It will be deleted in the future.\nGet the new one from here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5996567/TTC_VIDEO_-_Biology_-_Science_of_Life_%28compressed%29_public&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5996567/TTC_VIDEO_-_Biology_-_Science_of_Life_%28compressed%29_public&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nExplanations:\nInitially, I made this torrent private, not knowing exactly I did so (utorrent issue).\nNow tpb doesn't allow private torrents anymore.\nSo I created a public torrent, copy of this:\n\nSorry for this situation.\nYou should:\n1. delete the old private torrent from you client (not the files:P).\n2. download the new public torrent\n3. open the torrent file with your torrent client.\n4. set the path to your old location (it will recognize every file)\n\nWhen you do correctly, the percentage of downloading the torrent will increase rapidly. This being a sign that your client recognized the old physical files.\n\nStep 4 could be a little tricky.\nIn my case, I use utorrent.\nI customized it, so that it downloads first in a temporary directory. Then it moves the files to desired location (in my case label name, ie ttc)\nSo in my case, before downloading the new public torrent, I first move physical old files in temp directory. \nThen utorrent sees every file. It finishes the verification. Then it moves the files back where they should be.\n\n----------\nEND UPDATE\n----------\n\n\n\n\nTTC VIDEO - Biology - Science of Life - part 1 of 2\n\nStephen Nowicki\nhttp://www.teach12.com/ttcx/coursedesclong2.aspx?cid=1500\n\n\nOne of the greatest scientific feats of our era is the astonishing progress made in understanding the intricate machinery of life. We are living in the most productive phase so far in this quest, as researchers delve ever deeper into the workings of living systems, turning their discoveries into new medical treatments, improved methods of growing food, and innovative new products.\n\n&quot;The 21st century will be the century of biological science, just as the 20th century was the century of physical science,&quot; predicts Professor Stephen Nowicki, an award-winning teacher at Duke University who has specially adapted his acclaimed introductory biology course for\nThe Teaching Company to bring you up to date on one of the most important fields of knowledge of our time.\n\nThis intensive, 72-lecture course will give you the background and guidance to explore in depth the fundamental principles of how living things work-principles such as evolution by natural selection, the cellular structure of organisms, the DNA theory of inheritance, and other key ideas that will help you appreciate the marvelous diversity and complexity of life.\n\n\n\nMore info: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.teach12.com/ttcx/coursedesclong2.aspx?cid=1500&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.teach12.com/ttcx/coursedesclong2.aspx?cid=1500&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nLectures:\n\n01.

It's the best converter/compressor I've used\n\n2. modify settings like this (or cut a little portion of video, then play around):\n 2.1 codec H264\n 2.2 set video width X 288 (width/288 must be equal to originalWidth/originalHeight)\n 2.3 set video bitrate somewhere between 240-270. I set it 240:P I didn't go lower.\n 2.4 set audio: mp3, audio bitrate 56kbs, sample rate 22050Hz\n\n3. Hit the button:D\nYou should get videos somewhere around 60-90 mb.\n\nThat's all\n(of course, then you create a torrent, then upload to tpb:D)\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86a04e2df2d97cc4b213b4d59656f05f072fffa1","amp;dn":"TTC+VIDEO+-+Biology+-+Science+of+Life+%28compressed+version+4.3GB%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86a04e2df2d97cc4b213b4d59656f05f072fffa1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,160,78,45,242,217,124,196,178,19,180,213,150,86,240,95,7,47,255,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
