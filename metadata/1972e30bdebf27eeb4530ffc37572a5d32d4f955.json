This agency takes on claims of miscarriages of justice, assessing whether there are grounds to reopen old cases.\n\nRose is brilliant but strong-willed and sometimes reckless. She likes to follow her instincts and play hunches and often comes into conflict with authority. Maloney, although Rose&amp;#039;s superior, usually allows himself to be led by his more passionate colleague. Maloney is a by-the-book man and a little grey. He finds working with Rose dangerous but addictively exciting.\n\nA pilot was first broadcast on ITV on 29 September 2002. A series of three stories followed in July 2005. A second series of three stories was aired in September 2006.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1972e30bdebf27eeb4530ffc37572a5d32d4f955","amp;dn":"Rose+and+Maloney+1-3+%28+All+seasons+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1972e30bdebf27eeb4530ffc37572a5d32d4f955","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,114,227,11,222,191,39,238,180,83,15,252,55,87,42,93,50,212,249,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
