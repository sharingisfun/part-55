Walter Wray supplied rock star vocals and Dominic Miller, who later played for Sting, made his six-string howl. Allen and keyboard player Steve Halliwell supplied radio-ready tunes that somehow eluded airplay. After this promising eponymous debut, which included the single &quot;Is This Love?,&quot; the group disbanded when its second album failed to generate much interest. (AMG)\n\n\n01.
