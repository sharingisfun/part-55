The Independent Media Center has edited over 100 hours of video footage into these 80 minutes and remarkably covers a good deal of ground. It was stunning to see the Seattle police become increasingly aggressive when dealing with the protesters. At the showing I attended, the audience audibly gasped when one police officer pulled a protester&amp;#039;s hood off so that he could spray some kind of tear gas-like chemical into her face more easily. If you like documentaries, particularly those by Michael Moore, don&amp;#039;t miss this one.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:120a5915324c401bfa3e82a4adb9fd55625e2649","amp;dn":"This+Is+What+Democracy+Looks+Like+-+documentary+2000","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"120a5915324c401bfa3e82a4adb9fd55625e2649","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,10,89,21,50,76,64,27,250,62,130,164,173,185,253,85,98,94,38,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
