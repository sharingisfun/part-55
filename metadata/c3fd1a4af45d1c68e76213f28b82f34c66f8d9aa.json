Our music is a plenty of\n many influences such as Radiohead, Audioslave, AC/DC, Muse, whilst still sounding \n unique. From the heavy but catchy riffs of Lost It, to Lights with it&amp;#039;s epic\n Pendulum esque intro, to the quiet lament of Unforgiven, they are a band with the\n talent to produce a variety of songs, whilst still sounding original and like\n themselves. \n\nThis is their first recorded CD.It is being distributed through torrents with \nthe permission of the band.
