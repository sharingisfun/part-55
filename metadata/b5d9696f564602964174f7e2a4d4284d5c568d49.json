It&amp;#039;s designed for Windows 32-bit 2000/XP/Vista. 64-bit reliability is not tested. It is designed to be easy to use while being CPU-efficient, so expect a fast and neat experience while downloading files.\n\nHow does it work?\nThe program checks the clipboard for new data about 10 times in a second, when something of interrest is found ÃƒÂ¢?? in other meaning a http/https/ftp-adress or a bitmap ÃƒÂ¢?? the program will cue it up. The cuelist is shown at the top right in the display (icon of three lines). SuperFetchs main strength is actually its cuelist, you can copy different adresses while downloading other content via SuperFetch ÃƒÂ¢?? and the program will cue every item in order so you wont loose a second link just because you copied a third one while downloading the first. The second icon to the right is showing how many downloadattempts that has been issued since the program started. The third icon shows how many actual files that is being held in the downloadfolder.\n\nEasiest way to copy images \nIf you use Internet Explorer 7 you can rightclick an image and choose ÃƒÂ¢??CopyÃƒÂ¢??, but unfortunately there is no fast way to get the location of an image, fastest would be to rightclick it and choose properties and then copy the URL. If you choose ÃƒÂ¢??CopyÃƒÂ¢??, the bitmap will be copied instead of its link, so the file wont download but will be regenerated as a PNG via SuperFetch.\n\nIf you use FireFox  (which is absolutely prefered in this case) you can rightclick the image and choose ÃƒÂ¢??Copy Image LocationÃƒÂ¢?? - and you&amp;#039;re done, expect the image to be in your downloaddirectory.\n\n(SuperFetch is designed to download any type of file, even html-files.)\n\nCueing multiple files at once (fusker)\nIf you want to download several files from the same location and the files are numbered from for instance 01 to 200, you can add tags to the link before you copy it to the clipboard.\n\nExample: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagehost.com/image[01-200].jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagehost.com/image[01-200].jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou can even do multiple fuskering\nExample: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagehost.com/gallery[1-5]/image[1-20].jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagehost.com/gallery[1-5]/image[1-20].jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf a link consists of * (wildcard) instead of brackets then SuperFetch will automatically replace them.\n\nImportant: Use this function with caution! It can cause high load to servers over the internet. It is strongly recommended that you only use this for files with a narrow numbervariety ÃƒÂ¢?? or at your own server/computer. This is your own responsabillity.\n\nFilling the list only\nRightclick on the On/Off-button (the blue circle to the far left), when it turns yellow you&amp;#039;re in listfill-mode. This will only cue files up but not start the download. Rightclick again (so it turns back to blue) to start your downloads.\n\nSetting the downloadfolder\nClick on the foldericon, default is C:\\ so it&amp;#039;s recommended to switch this to a preferred location. Rightclick the foldericon to open the folder via Windows Explorer.\n\nHiding the program to systemtray\nRightclick the minimizeicon or the systemtrayicon (black and white that says SF), leftclick the trayicon to make the program appear again.\n\nTaking a screenshot\nPress PrtScr on your keyboard, SuperFetch will store this as a PNG for you in your downloadfolder. Press Alt+PrtScr for active window only.\n\n\n\n\nDeveloped by WorkingArt - http://www.workingart.se/\n\nThis text in a downloadable PDF: http://www.workingart.se/development/superfetch/SuperFetch_Help.pdf\n\nUpdatelog: http://www.workingart.se/development/superfetch/update/updateLog.txt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5d9696f564602964174f7e2a4d4284d5c568d49","amp;dn":"SuperFetch.full.v1.0+-+Fuskerengine%2FBitmapcompiler+%28XP%2FVista+32-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5d9696f564602964174f7e2a4d4284d5c568d49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,217,105,111,86,70,2,150,65,116,247,226,164,212,40,77,92,86,141,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
