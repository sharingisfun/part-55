I recorded on the weekend and had to find out later that I had messed up the sound.\n\nAs an emergency fill in I made this. It?s a project I wanted to do for a long time - and did now without anny planning and preparation. I even forgot to take a tripod for the video camera with me. But the lab provided a clamp for Erlenmeyer flasks. Worked great. :-)\n\nI got the idea from Allan J. Ager and Simon Taylor from the Tips from the Top Floor Forum.\n\nYou can download the four finally used files and a shrinked xcf file as an archive from the website http://meetthegimp.org.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c916ab24be3d33802714e275a04fa296c7274948","amp;dn":"Meet_the_Gimp_Videopodcast_Episode_044_Multiple_Exposures","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c916ab24be3d33802714e275a04fa296c7274948","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,22,171,36,190,61,51,128,39,20,226,117,160,79,162,150,199,39,73,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
