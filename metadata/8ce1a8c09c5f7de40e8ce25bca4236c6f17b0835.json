The standout track for me is probably &quot;God is a Girl&quot; which some may have heard on an old Frontiers magazine sampler. But there&amp;#039;s some great songs,it almost has the feel of Jellyfish in places.If you like your music straight ahead with no twists then stay clear of this,but if you like a few surprises and like stuff a little &quot;different&quot; then check it out. ~ review from Heavy Harmonies\n\nDescribed as John Lennon fronting Jellyfish, there&amp;#039;s a definite Beatles influence, but this album ain&amp;#039;t for everyone! Try it though, you might like it ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ce1a8c09c5f7de40e8ce25bca4236c6f17b0835","amp;dn":"Horizontal+Ladies+Club+-+Horizontal+Ladies+Club+-+320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ce1a8c09c5f7de40e8ce25bca4236c6f17b0835","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,225,168,192,156,95,125,228,14,140,226,91,202,66,54,198,241,123,8,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
