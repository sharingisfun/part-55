Because of unfortunate delays, the EP had been in production for seven months and during that time, tracks were recorded that didn&amp;#039;t make it to the EP but also wouldn&amp;#039;t fit in on future releases. There&amp;#039;s the brilliant Unarmed Enemies remix that wasn&amp;#039;t included on the EP as the tracklist was already set. There&amp;#039;s the demo versions from madly efficient Flow Flux CLan as they did a couple of different takes before completing the remix of &quot;Ours is a time...&quot; that&amp;#039;s included on the EP. To wrap up this release, I also wanted to put out a live version from our release party gig at Klubb Shaktar in Ãƒâ€“rebro, a wonderful evening with lots of love in the air. Here they are. The leftovers. But even leftovers still hunger. We know that by now, right?     \n\nMr.Suitcase, Stockholm, July 2006&quot; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fb7d259d6e42a9f0fb6df6d313efbac9be0fe59","amp;dn":"Mr.Suitcase+-+Leftovers+EP+%282006-VBR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fb7d259d6e42a9f0fb6df6d313efbac9be0fe59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,183,210,89,214,228,42,159,15,182,223,109,49,62,251,172,155,224,254,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
