The game objective consists of rescuing the mascot of Iron Maiden, Eddie, from a prison while passing through game settings evocative of the albums. Music from the band completes the game's customizable soundtrack\n\nThe gameplay itself consists of shooting the appearing enemies with the mouse cursor. The game travels on &quot;a track&quot; and the player has no control over movement apart from occasionally choosing the route he will take through the levels. The player can select which tracks play in the background of which levels\n\nThe game passes through various levels, starting in a street, then to a mental institution, then into hell itself, and then into other various locations. The locations are from the covers of previous Iron Maiden records.\n\nInstall help:\n\nYou use disc 1 to do the install\nIf you are using virtual drives (daemon tools,alcohol 120,etc...)\nyou will need to play disk 2 in that same drive that you did the install with.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8187bcc5e3c9e6fbdb3b4384c7b02ad91a16d69","amp;dn":"iron+maiden+ed+hunter.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8187bcc5e3c9e6fbdb3b4384c7b02ad91a16d69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,24,123,204,94,60,158,111,189,179,180,56,76,123,2,173,145,161,109,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
