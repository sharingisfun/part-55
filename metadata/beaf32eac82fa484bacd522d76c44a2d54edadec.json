For hard-core HawkFans only...\n\nBand: Hawkwind\nVenue: Barnstaple Queens Hall (now known as Queens Theatre)\nDate: 10 July 1976\nAUD: internal mic\n\nLineage: original cassette tape &gt; 2nd gen tape (1976) &gt; WAV (2006: Cakewalk GTP) &gt;\n\n\nRun time: 14 mins. Bits of the gig.\n===================================\n\nThere&amp;#039;d normally be little point in releasing a rather sound-distorted 14-mins tape of a post-75 Hawkwind gig, as there&amp;#039;s at least one decent recording around from every tour from 1976 on. However, I think the July 1976 gig was unique. This was an isolated summer gig, falling inbetween the big spring and autumn tours of &amp;#039;76, and maybe Brock was feeling experimental - it exceeded even the Greasy Truckers 1971 gig for for the intensity of the spacey interlinks. This is Hawkwind as very few people have ever heard them, devastatingly cosmic.\n\nIf anyone&amp;#039;s heard a more noisy and dramatic version of The Awakening - anywhere, ever - then I&amp;#039;ll be amazed. And Brock&amp;#039;s guitaring on the start of Brainstorm has the intensity of a brace of road drills, but Calvert&amp;#039;s vocals can be heard, albeit deep down in the mix. The audio overload of the microphone doubtless has a bearing on the sound of the guitar here.\n\nRecording history at the time:\n==============================\n\nThe first 40 mins of the gig were taped using a portable cassette recorder and its internal mic, down near the right-hand speaker stack. Given this - and that information is enough to make an audiophile cringe - the sound&amp;#039;s surprisingly clear. We&amp;#039;re not talking early 70s bass-swamped murk, here. (The reason only 40 mins was taped was that we forgot to turn the casette over.)\n\nGraham: &quot;I was holding [the cassette deck] at the start. During Golden Void I wanted to dance around so I put it on this table near the speakers. The guy sitting there gave me a funny look but then ignored it.&quot;\n\nA few days later, swooshy highlights of that tape were copied to another casette, for someone who wanted to hear the spacey interlinks, and then - a few days after that, the master tape was lost somewhere in the east Devon countryside. So only this 14-min highlights tape survives. \n\n(Note to all Devon farmers: if you find a 30-year-old C90 cassette tape marked &amp;#039;Hawkwind&amp;#039; in one of your fields, can you please return it to us, thanks...)\n\n\nLine-up:\n--------\n\nDave Brock                    \nPaul Rudolph\nAlan Powell &amp; Simon King\nBob Calvert       \nNik Turner                     \nSimon House\n\n1 ASSAULT - start // end (2:20 total) //\n\n2 G VOID - middle // end (3:30 total) - continues with The Awakening...\n\n3 THE AWAKENING &amp; part of OPA LOKA (2:26) //\n\n4 SPACEY INTERLINK (2:52) - continues with Brainstorm... \n\n5 BRAINSTORM (start) (1:10) //\n\n6 SPACEY INTERLINK (0:45) //\n\n7 STEPPENWOLF (start // middle) (1:16)\n\ntotal time 14:24                        ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:beaf32eac82fa484bacd522d76c44a2d54edadec","amp;dn":"Hawkwind+1976-07-10+Barnstaple+%2814+mins+for+entheusiasts+only%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"beaf32eac82fa484bacd522d76c44a2d54edadec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,175,50,234,200,47,164,132,186,205,82,45,118,196,74,45,84,237,173,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
