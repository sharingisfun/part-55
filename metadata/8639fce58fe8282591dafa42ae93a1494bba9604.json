Archive names in rar.log error log file always include\n      the full path.\n\n   2. WinRAR tray icon is compatible with high DPI display modes.\n\n   3. If you modified a file in archive with encrypted names using\n      an external editor, WinRAR will not ask for archive password again\n      when prompting to update a file. It will use a password which\n      you entered when opening an archive,\n\n   4. Bugs fixed:\n\n      a) switch -tl and &quot;Set archive time to latest file time&quot; option\n         could fail in previous version. Sometimes they set archive time\n         to current system time instead of latest file time;\n\n      b) if -ag switch mask contained archive number, month and minute\n         characters, WinRAR placed &amp;#039;I&amp;#039; character instead of minute value\n         into generated archive name for archive numbers exceeding 1;\n\n      c) high ASCII names in ISO files using ISO 9660 format without\n         Joliet format extension were displayed incorrectly;\n\n      d) WinRAR could crash when decompressing some of corrupt RAR archives;\n\n      e) if &quot;Turn PC off when done&quot; option was set in &quot;Convert archives&quot;\n         command, WinRAR turned PC off after converting the first archive\n         in selected group instead of after converting the entire group;\n\n      f) if user specified a non-existent destination path in SFX archive\n         in Vista, SFX could enter into infinite &quot;create new SFX window&quot;\n         loop;\n\n      g) WinRAR could fail to unpack an individual file from subfolder\n         of ACE archive using the drag and drop.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8639fce58fe8282591dafa42ae93a1494bba9604","amp;dn":"WinRAR_3_71.exe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8639fce58fe8282591dafa42ae93a1494bba9604","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,57,252,229,143,232,40,37,145,218,250,66,174,147,161,73,75,186,150,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
