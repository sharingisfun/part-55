It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s made with practically no budget, often\nwritten on the fly.  It doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;t have the mathematical rigour of classical music,\nor the overproduced sound of pop/rock.  It ranges from the depressing, to the\nexciting, to the relaxing.   You can study to it in the background, or focus on\nit.\n\nI hope you enjoy it.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thedark.jabberwocky.ca/music&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thedark.jabberwocky.ca/music&lt;/a&gt;\n\n(Creative Commons Canada deed 3.0 by-sa)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9dddf3f00b5f1400a7179697507ba0f5f498263","amp;dn":"Some+Jeff+Cliff+Music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9dddf3f00b5f1400a7179697507ba0f5f498263","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,221,223,63,0,181,241,64,10,113,121,105,117,7,186,15,95,73,130,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
