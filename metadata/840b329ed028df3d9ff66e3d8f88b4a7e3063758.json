Fabio Capello will be hoping his side fare better than in their last match, which they lost 1-0 to France. While the rest of Europe\\&amp;#039;s major footballing nations prepare for this summer\\&amp;#039;s European Championships, England must instead turn their focus to the 2010 World Cup qualifiers, which begin in the autumn - and this friendly will give Capello another chance to work out his best XI. Includes the \\&amp;#039;Goal of the season\\&amp;#039; competition!\n\nIn addition to the MOTD Live coverage, post match interviews from BBC Interactive are also included.
