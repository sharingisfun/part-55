In Asia, KhanÃ‚Â´s ruthless Golden Horde wages a war of terror from the shores of Japan to Europe. In Arabia, the legendary AssassinsÃ‚Â´ Guild asserts a bid for power, toppling sultans and kings. Europe, once a promising glimpse of humanityÃ‚Â´s potential, has become a well of despair under the despotic rule of a handful of feudal lords. Many great kingdoms have been devastated, but a few have grown more powerful. These comprise the Covenant of Seven - lords who have allied with Asmodeus, a practitioner of the dark arts who wields the fabled Mace of Tanis. The Mace is imbued with necropotic energy, offering those who wield it a tantalizing promise of ever-lasting life and unbridled power. With this power comes a terrible price: Asmodeus must feed off despair, disease, and poverty. In limited doses, Asmodeus grants the Seven the power they need and crave. In return, they expand their kingdoms with bloody battles and torment their peasants. But Europe can no longer sustain AsmodeusÃ‚Â´ ravenous appetite. He now reaches East into the Orient, to find new lords who yearn to sample the dark powers. But there is rebellion. Each of the Seven, addicted to the corrupting power of the Mace, dispatch their best warriors to kill Asmodeus and steal his power. Leaders from the East sense AsmodeusÃ‚Â´ plottings and strive to destroy him before itÃ‚Â´s too late. Heirs to kingdoms long since vanquished seek revenge on Asmodeus and those who wield the dark energy. They are the fiercest fighters on Earth, and they all have one thing in common: they each must possess the Mace.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6570af890933762a649270ca25a752d4b1f70d7d","amp;dn":"Mace+The+Dark+Age+%5BPAL+-+Wii+-+VC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6570af890933762a649270ca25a752d4b1f70d7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,112,175,137,9,51,118,42,100,146,112,202,37,167,82,212,177,247,13,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
