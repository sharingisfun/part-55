Wild stuff.  Like really wild.  See the link below for a complete as possible track list.  The first track on the first show is a Jeff Mangum original (and first new material since In The Aeroplane. sorta):\n\n\\&quot; ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ \\&quot;To Animate The Body With The Cocoon of the Her Unconscious Christ The Mother Removes Her Death Body of 1910 Only To Be Reborn In The Same Spirit as a School of Blow Fish Believing in the Coming of the Milk Christ\\&quot; - The Long Warm Wall of Alfred Snouts {This lengthy titled track is an original Jeff Mangum sound collage, described in Jeff\\&amp;#039;s interview with Pitchfork from February 2002: a long string of vivid sounds... A cathedral bell, a man coughing, an accordion playing, hooves clomping, children cheering, a snippet of a woman telling a dream in a lilting English accent: \\&quot;...and he brought me and my sister up the tower, and he showed me my parents, who he turned into pieces of fish...\\&quot;} \\&quot;\n\nAdd in lots of odd jazz, well known jazz, music concrete, nature recordings by Douglas Quinn, hungarian folk, calypso, classical, american primitive, folk, psych and Stephen Hawking lectures.\n\nNOTE:  this came as mp3s on a CD-R from: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.neutralmilkhotel.org/wfmu.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.neutralmilkhotel.org/wfmu.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\\&quot;streaming RealAudio was captured to wav, \ndivided into segments (usually where Jeff comes in), and encoded to \n160kbps MP3s using EAC (LAME 3.93). I would have encoded higher, but \n160k worked best resulting in three shows fitting snuggly on a disc, for \na total of 3 discs for the 9 shows (27+ hours of music).\\&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3859a7c60fcdf5ba821e4d2037907f58fe664223","amp;dn":"Jefferson+Mangum+-+The+WFMU+Archive+Vol+1-3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3859a7c60fcdf5ba821e4d2037907f58fe664223","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,89,167,198,15,205,245,186,130,30,77,32,55,144,127,88,254,102,66,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
