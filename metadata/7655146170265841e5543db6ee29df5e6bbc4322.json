Now u can travel everywhere, but the 1st \n                time u travel u get &quot;again&quot; a black Screen. (Seems to be 50:50 with Blackscreen,\n                cos of our Target). So, type in Console &quot;at bioa_nor00.\n                You are now on Normandy (again) and see the door is looked, but..! and now the clue...\n                go again to Galaxy-Map and zoom once more in, and click the Planet u want, \n                and then....click on &quot;Land&quot;. This funtion is in the &quot;Planet-Descryption&quot;\n                after the zoom before :))\n\n                At a few Planets u cant land so the Button Survey appears and u can collect Minerals.\n\n                I also noticed that u cant get over dock at c-sec on your ship. \n                Determinatin Progress is endless and u can move in there, what u \n                normaly not suppose to can. So i think after finishing a Planet u have \n                to get to Normandy with Console.\n\n\n\n                   ???????????????????????????????????????????   \n\n                                  Have many fun ;D\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7655146170265841e5543db6ee29df5e6bbc4322","amp;dn":"MASS.EFFECT.CRACKFiX.READ.NFO-iND.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7655146170265841e5543db6ee29df5e6bbc4322","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,85,20,97,112,38,88,65,229,84,61,182,238,41,223,94,107,188,67,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
