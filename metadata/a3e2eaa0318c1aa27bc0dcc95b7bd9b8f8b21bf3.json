I took all the PDF\\&amp;#039;s, converted them to JPG\\&amp;#039;s and packed them into CBZ\\&amp;#039;s so they could be read by the various comic viewers out there (CDDisplay, ComicRack, etc.) I also broke it up by the decades so it would be easier to download than the original 5 gig download.\n\nAll credit for this goes to the original uploader and/or scanner. I just did the conversion from PDF to JPG and packed them. Of course I did this over 450 times. :)\n\n*Note\nI have done all the decades, I just started with this one as it was requested.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3e2eaa0318c1aa27bc0dcc95b7bd9b8f8b21bf3","amp;dn":"A+Decade+of+the+X-Men+-+The+1990%5C%27s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3e2eaa0318c1aa27bc0dcc95b7bd9b8f8b21bf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,226,234,160,49,140,26,162,123,192,220,201,91,123,217,184,248,178,27,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
