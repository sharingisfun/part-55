It was released on March 11, 1995 in Japan, and August 22, 1995 in North America. The gameÃ‚Â´s story follows a group of young adventurers who travel through time to prevent a global catastrophe. Chrono Trigger was developed by a group that Square called the &quot;Dream Team&quot;, consisting of Hironobu Sakaguchi, Kazuhiko Aoki, and composer Nobuo Uematsu?known for their works on the Final Fantasy series?and Yuuji Horii and artist Akira Toriyama, developers for the Dragon Quest series.[1] Masato Kato wrote most of the plot, while composer Yasunori Mitsuda scored most of the game before falling ill and deferring his duties to Uematsu.[2][3] Nintendo Power magazine described certain aspects of Chrono Trigger as revolutionary, including its multiple endings, plot-related sidequests focusing on character development, unique battle system, and detailed graphics.[4] Square re-released a ported version by TOSE in Japan for the Sony PlayStation in 1999, later repackaged with a Final Fantasy IV port as Final Fantasy Chronicles in 2001. It has never been released in PAL territories.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c207cef63e3128c7ae81d3294ccfae226392c179","amp;dn":"Chrono+Trigger+%5BPAL+-+Wii+-+VC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c207cef63e3128c7ae81d3294ccfae226392c179","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,7,206,246,62,49,40,199,174,129,211,41,76,207,174,34,99,146,193,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
