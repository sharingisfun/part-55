But when the westward strike drove him across the Arkansas Territory into Texas, he finally found himself a home-in the middle of a bloody war.\r\n\r\nTexans like Jim Bowie and Sam Houston were waging a fierce struggle against Santa Ana's Mexican army and Jami MacCallister made the perfect scout for the fledgling volunteer force. What lay ahead of them was a place called the Alamo, thirteen days of blood dust and courage and a battle that would become an undying legend of the American West...\r\nÂ© 1993 William W. Johnstone.
