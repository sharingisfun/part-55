With Ray Manzarek now the band&amp;#039;s main focal point, the Doors released two classic albums (&quot;Other Voices&quot; in 1971 and &quot;Full Circle&quot; in 1972) and toured. This performance is apparently the only professional document remaining of this sadly obscure period and was filmed for German television. The Doors perform songs old and new and thus this very good-quality video is essential for Doors fans as it presents a rarely seen chapter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1af4ec651a8094008d94b49d7d9d3c10c2ddd01","amp;dn":"The+Doors+Live+TV+1972","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1af4ec651a8094008d94b49d7d9d3c10c2ddd01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,175,78,198,81,168,9,64,8,217,75,73,215,217,211,193,12,45,221,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
