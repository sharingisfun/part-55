This is shame, because the songs I have been lucky enough to hear... he songs shared with me that I am now sharing with you all   are AWESOME.\n\nHere is their self-titled release (also known as 45 RPM) on Egg Records. It is three songs and five tracks; the last two tracks are demo versions of &quot;Secret Goldfish&quot; and &quot;Real World&quot; that are just.. man, listen for yourself.\n\nI have not found a copy of their LP, One Thousand Secrets, yet, though after 45 RPM  I really, REALLY want to now. I have a feeling it will prolly be a bit of a challenge, as I suspect that it was only ever released on vinyl.
