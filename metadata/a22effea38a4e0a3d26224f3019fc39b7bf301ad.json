This is my final project.\n\nRadiohead held an online contest to remix &quot;Nude&quot; from their album - &quot;In Rainbows&quot; This was quite a difficult task for everybody that entered, as Nude is in 6/8 timing, and 63bpm. Most music that&amp;#039;s played in clubs is around 120bpm and usually 4/4 timing. It&amp;#039;s pretty difficult to seamlessly mix a waltz beat into a DJ set.\n\nThis resulted in lots of generic entries consisting of a typical 4/4 beat, but with arbitrary clips from &quot;Nude&quot; thrown in so that they qualified for the contest.\n\nThom Yorke joked at the ridiculousness of it in an interview for NPR radio, hinting that they set the competition to find out how people would approach such a challenging task.\n\nI decided to take the piss a bit, as the contest seemed to be in that spirit.\n\nBased on the lyric (and alternate title) &quot;Big Ideas: Don&amp;#039;t get any&quot; I grouped together a collection of old redundant hardware, and placed them in a situation where they&amp;#039;re trying their best to do something that they&amp;#039;re not exactly designed to do, and not quite getting there.\n\nIt doesn&amp;#039;t sound great, as it&amp;#039;s not supposed to.\n\nI missed the contest deadline, so I&amp;#039;m offering it here for you to enjoy.\n\nSinclair ZX Spectrum - Guitars (rhythm &amp; lead)\nEpson LX-81 Dot Matrix Printer - Drums\nHP Scanjet 3c - Bass Guitar\nHard Drive array - Act as a collection of bad speakers - Vocals &amp; FX","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a22effea38a4e0a3d26224f3019fc39b7bf301ad","amp;dn":"James+Houston+-+Big+Ideas+%28don%5C%27t+get+any%29+--+Radiohead+-+Nude","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a22effea38a4e0a3d26224f3019fc39b7bf301ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,46,255,234,56,164,224,163,210,98,36,243,1,159,195,155,123,243,1,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
