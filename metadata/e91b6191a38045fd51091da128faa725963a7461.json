They chose the latter and Anti-Flag was born. Despite multiple line-up changes, differing political ideologies, and their status as a fledgling independent band, Anti-Flag gained popularity in the punk community, ultimately releasing six albums on various independent labels (ranging from A-F Records, to Fat Wreck Chords, to Go Kart Records). In 2005, the band signed to RCA Records.\n\nThe band supports animal rights and PETA, and they are all vegetarians and/or vegan.\n\n\nThis is the full discography of AntiFlag.\n\nOfficial Website : http://www.anti-flag.com/\n\nSeed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e91b6191a38045fd51091da128faa725963a7461","amp;dn":"AntiFlag+-+Full+Discography+-+%5B8.Albums%2BCovers%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e91b6191a38045fd51091da128faa725963a7461","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,27,97,145,163,128,69,253,81,9,29,161,40,250,167,37,150,58,116,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
