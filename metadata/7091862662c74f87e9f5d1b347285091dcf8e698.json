In\r\nfront of 50,000 people, Rod delivered not his usual stadium set but a bespoke\r\nselection of hits from his back catalogue spanning his career, including\r\nGasoline Alley, Angel, In a Broken Dream and The Killing of Georgie\r\n(Part 1 &amp; 2), plus Faces classics such as Ooh La La and the blues standard\r\nRollin' and Tumblin', a number that Rod used to perform with Long John Baldry\r\nback in the day. To close the set Rod brought on his old pal guitarist Jim\r\nCregan to help him perform his 1978 hit I Was Only Joking.\r\n\r\nAll in all, a memorable and unique concert that is unlikely to be repeated\r\nanytime soon.\r\n\r\nSCREENS\r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/30526737462777203296.png  \r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/65480730370148030840.png\r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/35788462804826376944.png\r\n\r\nFORMAT:.......................: MPEG-4/MP4\r\nFULLSIZE:.....................: 581 MiB\r\nRESOLUTION:...................: 720*404=16:9\r\nFRAME RATE:...................: 25.000 fps\r\nAUDIO AAC:....................: 256 Kbps\r\nCHANNELS:.....................: 2 Front: L/R [Stereo]\r\nLANGUAGE:.....................: English\r\nSUBTITLES:....................: NONE\r\nRUNTIME:......................: 59mn 44s\r\nENCODER:......................: oneanight\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7091862662c74f87e9f5d1b347285091dcf8e698","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Rod+Stewart+Live+at+Hyde+Park+2015+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7091862662c74f87e9f5d1b347285091dcf8e698","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,145,134,38,98,199,79,135,233,245,209,179,71,40,80,145,220,248,230,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
