In my opinion, they are the epitome of Death Metal.  With entirely brutal lyrics filled with vivid descriptions of gore, death, mutilation, sadism, murder, malice, evisceration, decapitation, devitalization, masturbation, and many more beautiful things; they reign supreme in the Death Metal genre, and prove to consistently set the bar (if not, align themselves with such gods as Cannibal Corpse), and give a new, yet old, meaning to the genre of Death Metal.
