His own.\n\nA thriller about a college professor who, while moonlighting as a forensic psychiatrist for the FBI, receives a death threat telling him that he has only 88 minutes to live.

Especially if you&amp;#039;re a Pacino fan like me.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd5ac279fd420174e3b8a5065c971fb59d2e380b","amp;dn":"88+Minutes+%5B2007%5DDvDrip%5BEng%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd5ac279fd420174e3b8a5065c971fb59d2e380b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,90,194,121,253,66,1,116,227,184,165,6,92,151,31,181,157,46,56,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
