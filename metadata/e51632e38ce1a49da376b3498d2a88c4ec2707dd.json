He responds by seeking an interview with Georgia's governor (David Ogden Stiers) and uncovers a hidden scandal. There are a handful of guilty pleasure moments, such as a scene in which Wally accidentally breaks the penis off one of the governor's marble statues and hides it in his pants pocket . . . you can guess the rest. Otherwise there's not much to write home about, except for a number of cameos, including Oprah Winfrey and Roseanne.\n\nQuincyMKT","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e51632e38ce1a49da376b3498d2a88c4ec2707dd","amp;dn":"Meet+Wally+Sparks+%281997%29+%5BDVDRip%2C+1.85+WS%2C+Eng%5D+-+QuincyMKT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e51632e38ce1a49da376b3498d2a88c4ec2707dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,22,50,227,140,225,164,157,163,118,179,73,141,42,136,196,236,39,7,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
