Use TreeSize as a hard disk cleanup tool: find space hogs and remove them. Graphical analyses provide a quick visualization of disk space usage. TreeSize Professional shows you folder size and allocated disk space as well as owner and permissions, the last access date, the NTFS compression rate, and much more information for selected folders or drives.\r\n\r\nSearch for Redundant Files\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nThe integrated versatile file search helps you find old, big, temporary, and duplicate files on drives, entire servers or the entire network. Search results can be moved, deleted or exported to a ZIP file.\r\n\r\nPrint, Export, or Compare Results\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou can print detailed reports and charts or export the collected data to many different formats such as XML, XLS, TXT, CSV and many more. Compare XML reports or take shapshots of your disk space usage to track its development over time.\r\n\r\nThe application has an intuitive Explorer-like user interface and supports drag and drop operations. It is fast, multi-threaded, and supports Unicode- and NTFS-specific features. TreeSize Professional can be started from the context menu of every folder or drive (not available in portable version).\r\n\r\nChanges in 6.2.3\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n- Bugfix: Imported XML reports are no longer missing &quot;Expand&quot; symbols.\r\n- Bugfix: When reading an XML report with multiple scans, the scans are now shown again grouped. The progress shown while reading reports has been improved.\r\n- Bugfix: MSI Installer: The property &quot;ALLUSERS&quot; has a valid value again.\r\n- Bugfix: We now avoid a potential delay when TreeSize is started &quot;as administrator&quot; and cannot connect to a mapped network drive.\r\n- Bugfix: The default Excel export file path, that can be adjusted in the Options dialog, is now memorized again.\r\n- Bugfix: If a printed report contained some compressed items printed in blue, all following items were also printed in blue. This is no longer the case.\r\n- Bugfix: File Search: Sorting by the column &quot;Dir level&quot; is significantly faster now.\r\n- Bugfix: File Search Personal Edition: The &quot;Add&quot; Button in the dialog &quot;Checkmark if...&quot; is no longer disabled.\r\n\r\nNote\r\n----\r\n\r\nTreeSize Professional requires version 4.0 of the .NET Framework to work properly, please make sure that the current .NET version is installed.\r\nDuring its installation TreeSize Professional checks the available .NET version. If necessary, TreeSize will update the framework automatically.\r\n\r\nHomepage http://www.jam-software.com/treesize/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7baef67e37a7d24440925120190761cd5bd3095a","amp;dn":"TreeSize+Professional+6.2.3.1074+%28x86%2Fx64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7baef67e37a7d24440925120190761cd5bd3095a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,174,246,126,55,167,210,68,64,146,81,32,25,7,97,205,91,211,9,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
