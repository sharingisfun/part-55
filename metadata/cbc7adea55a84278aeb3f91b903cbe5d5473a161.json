Live all the way from the White Isles trendiest Bar. 4 complete sets of the Ibiza summer sound. DJ Mikael &amp; Yoshi do the usual damage with some fantastic tunes &amp; mixing. Base Bar resident DJ James Scott plays a blinder with his own style. Finally, flown in from Holland, Dries Van Hoorn with his electro house set. Dries is gaining a big reputation but, to be honest, I wasn&amp;#039;t that impressed.\n\nParty People let me know what you think and please, please SEED.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbc7adea55a84278aeb3f91b903cbe5d5473a161","amp;dn":"%2A%2AIbiza+Live+Mix+Vol.3+Base+Bar+2008%2A%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbc7adea55a84278aeb3f91b903cbe5d5473a161","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,199,173,234,85,168,66,120,174,179,249,27,144,60,190,93,84,115,161,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
