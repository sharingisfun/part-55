The imperialistic musicindustry is conquering the land of the free music and subjecting their citiezen on the height of their power. The whole world is occupied...the whole world? Sorry, no. A small village is still offering resistance to the commerzial invaders successfully, although they are encircled by their enemies. Here is this village...\n\n...and the years of rebellion aren&amp;#039;t over, yet.\n\nNow serious: This is my small rebelliontank against the commercial music. I understand by this, that there are Labelmanagers who are getting rich by selling too expencive cds or giving bad contracts to the artists. Of course, i know it is the fault of the society because they have the choice (yes, this world is really democratic) to buy or to don&amp;#039;t buy the cds. Pirate copies are a good option for the poor people - and we are all poor^^ - at this point and I can&amp;#039;t be angry with them because music is a mainnecessity of every human. \nJust to clear that before: My oppinion is that it isn&amp;#039;t commercial if the musicians can finance their lives with their art and i don&amp;#039;t mean to swim in money.\n\nI want to give an alternative. I am going to release one free-online-compilation each year with bands that you support for sure, if you buy their cds. I will support every album that i&amp;#039;ve noticed that is downloadable for free in the www as good as I can. Mouthpropaganda, link to their page, a song in a dj-set...\n\nI know, I can&amp;#039;t change the musicindustry, but as long as there is anyone who fights against the commercialism and capitalism of whatever, nothing is lost. This is my spirit i am holding myself on. \n\nGreetings\nHardcorenils\n\n\nKICK ASS BLEEDING EDGE UNDERGROUND SAMPLER !!!  THE FUTURE OF TEH SCENE !!!\n\nTHX DJ HARDCORENILS !!!
