Not long into the vacation, the unexpected happens -- Connie&amp;#039;s sister Kate, Kate&amp;#039;s know-it-all husband Roman Craig, and Kate and Roman&amp;#039;s twin daughters Mara and Cara crash the vacation. Roman proceeds to get on Chet&amp;#039;s nerves -- so much that Chet is ready and willing to pack up and go home, even as teenager Buck tries to romance a local girl named Cammie. It turns out that the reason why Roman, Kate, and the twins crashed the vacation is because the Craigs are broke, and Roman was planning to borrow $25,000 from Chet.\n\nRating:G \n\nRelease Date: 1988-11-10 1 hour 30 minutes 26 seconds or 91 minutes\n\nDVD Format: Snap Case, Widescreen Anamorphic, Pan &amp; Scan , 1.85:1, Color \n\nDVD Features: Subtitles: English, Spanish, German, French, Audio Track 1: French, Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround, Audio Track 2: English, Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround, Audio Track 3: German, Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround, Audio Track 4: Italian, Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround, Audio Track 5: Spanish, Dolby Digital 2.0\n\nDan Aykroyd ...
