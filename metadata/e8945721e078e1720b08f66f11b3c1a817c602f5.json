It takes a constructive viewpoint in commutative algebra and studies algorithmic approaches alongside several abstract classical theories. Indeed, it revisits these traditional topics with a new and simplifying manner, making the subject both accessible and innovative.\r\n\r\nThe algorithmic aspects of such naturally abstract topics as Galois theory, Dedekind rings, PrÃ¼fer rings, finitely generated projective modules, dimension theory of commutative rings, and others in the current treatise, are all analysed in the spirit of the great developers of constructive algebra in the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThis updated and revised edition contains over 350 well-arranged exercises, together with their helpful hints for solution. A basic knowledge of linear algebra, group theory, elementary number theory as well as the fundamentals of ring and module theory is required. Commutative Algebra: Constructive Methods will be useful for graduate students, and also researchers, instructors and theoretical computer scientists","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8945721e078e1720b08f66f11b3c1a817c602f5","amp;dn":"Commutative+Algebra+-+Constructive+Methods+-++Henri+Lombardi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8945721e078e1720b08f66f11b3c1a817c602f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,148,87,33,224,120,225,114,11,8,246,111,17,179,193,168,23,198,2,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
