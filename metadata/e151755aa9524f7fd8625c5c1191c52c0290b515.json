The games official name is &amp;#039;Special Operation&amp;#039;.\n\nThe graphics are poor... and after playing it for about 5 minutes, I got bored. But it was fun in the beginning. It was the first Iranian made game that I had played.\n\nThe game requires &amp;#039;at least&amp;#039; a pentium3/Athlon 1.2ghz, 64mb graphic card and 500mb space along with 512mb ram.\n\nThe game has no crack file and no viruses.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e151755aa9524f7fd8625c5c1191c52c0290b515","amp;dn":"Save+the+nuke+Scientists+-+Iranian+video+game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e151755aa9524f7fd8625c5c1191c52c0290b515","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,81,117,90,169,82,79,127,216,98,92,92,17,145,197,44,2,144,181,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
