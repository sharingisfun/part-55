After for years of nearly nonstop performing, CCR sounds as polished and tight as ever on this album. Of the two hit singles from this LP, &amp;#039;&amp;#039;Hey Tonight&amp;#039;&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;&amp;#039;Have You Ever Seen the Rain?,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; the latter&amp;#039;s slower ballad format clearly suggests the band was exploring new areas of its music, including a developing emphasis on instrumentals. With this swing of pendulum the creative task would be in the future shared by all members of the group. A fine and tasty offering, Pendulum marks not only the end of an era but is the last LP to be recored by all members of the original band, one that is still universally acknowledged as among the greatest in the annals of rock.\n\n- back side of CD case, no author written.\n\nMP3 Quality:128Kpbs\nTotal Length: 42:00 (rounded off to the nearest minute)\n\nTrack list:\n1.
