It&amp;#039;s a sound that&amp;#039;s being explored a bit lately by New Zealand artists, notably Wellington-based ones like Bret, his Black Seed&amp;#039;s co-member Barnaby &quot;Flash Harry&quot; Weir, Age Prior and The Phoenix Foundation as well. Over the nine tracks on &amp;#039;Prototype&amp;#039; (making it more of a mini-LP), Bret exudes a whispy, folk sound in both song writing and vocals, &quot;Dawnskate-88&quot; is a prime example with the softness of parts (lyrics, singing) of it juxtaposed with some very punchy drum programming and percussion, especially over the last few minutes where thing really begin to roll. The closing track &quot;Slip Away&quot; does break the mould of the rest of the album though, coming off with a very Air sound, all swirling electronic washes and atmospherics. While this is a good collection of songs, no doubt there, a few more tracks and a bit more &quot;oomph&quot; - such as on the multi-tracking on the chorus of &quot;Let Her Go&quot; - would have gone a long way. A great companion piece to Age Pryor&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;City Chorus&amp;#039;, the excellent self-titled Flash Harry album, and an intriguing sidestep from both The Black Seeds and Flight of the Conchords sounds. Recommended.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3d7d466e3f8fd99ffb5d7bc107e1c0dca5a2f28","amp;dn":"Video+Kid+-+Prototype+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3d7d466e3f8fd99ffb5d7bc107e1c0dca5a2f28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,215,212,102,227,248,253,153,255,181,215,188,16,126,28,13,202,90,47,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
