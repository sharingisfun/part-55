He wants to write screenplays, and he has a great idea. Trouble is, he&amp;#039;s not much with a typewriter; so, when his cousin calls and says a producer likes the idea and wants a script, Alex swallows his homophobia and asks for help from Elliot Springer, a talented writer who&amp;#039;s an insecure, gay, Jewish nebbish. Elliot doesn&amp;#039;t want the job, but Alex sets him up with Joey, a good-looking actor who works in the cafe. Elliot and Joey are soon getting it on, the script is slowly emerging, and Alex is discovering the beauty of Gwen, a woman in his writing class. Then, ego and greed threaten the partnership.\n\nNo subs\n\nRated R for language, sexual content and some violent images. :P","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:719d85214cd065e9660ba79665a9d42b98feb53a","amp;dn":"Hit+and+Runway+%281999%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"719d85214cd065e9660ba79665a9d42b98feb53a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,157,133,33,76,208,101,233,102,11,167,150,101,169,212,43,152,254,181,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
