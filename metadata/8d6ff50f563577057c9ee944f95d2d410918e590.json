This is useful for seamless playback and/or editing of DVD video on your harddrive. Don't use it to join several DVDS, just use it to join a vobset from same DVD. (Vobmerge uses the &quot;copy /b&quot; to join the files). You can also use it to join MPGs with same properties, select All files when you add files and save/merge as a new mpg.[/color]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d6ff50f563577057c9ee944f95d2d410918e590","amp;dn":"VOBMerge+2.52","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d6ff50f563577057c9ee944f95d2d410918e590","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,111,245,15,86,53,119,5,124,158,233,68,249,93,45,65,9,24,229,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
