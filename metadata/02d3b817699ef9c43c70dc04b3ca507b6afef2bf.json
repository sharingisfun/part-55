It is NOT compatible with other previous releases and is a standalone program.\n\nExtract the zip file to the location of your choice and it will create a directory called Autopatcher_XP.  Browse to this directory and run \\&quot;autopatcher.exe\\&quot; to begin the patch selection process.\n\nAutopatcher is developed by Antonis Kaladis and Jason Kelley and the latest Autopatcher Updater can be obtained on the Autopatcher forums.  Current version is 1.0.4, which fixes the freezing bug that has troubled previous releases.
