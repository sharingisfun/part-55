Some improvements\n include great mod-ability--you can actually change weapon values, and create new ones, \nand make and edit your own bots. The game also has better graphics; now the camera moves \nwith your soldier. Plus, there are cool special effects. The game has tons of mods, maps,\n sounds, weapons, and stuff to download. The only disadvantage is it&amp;#039;s not playable online.\nRequirements:\n    Windows Me/XP","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a23a5f47c30ef83a94e76defb5fc2b6b975323b4","amp;dn":"Stick+Soldiers+II+PC+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a23a5f47c30ef83a94e76defb5fc2b6b975323b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,58,95,71,195,14,248,58,148,231,109,239,181,252,43,107,151,83,35,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
