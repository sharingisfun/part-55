Andy didn&amp;#039;t know the\n\nmiddle of the fretboard was hitting the mike, creating a few pops\n\n(that have been minimized in the mastering).\n\nThe dickhead manager pulled Andy off the stage five minutes early, citing\n\nthe popping noise as the reason, as Andy&amp;#039;s fault, calling Andy &quot;abrasive&quot;.\n\nWhat a stupid motherfucking fuck. The reality is that the sound guy is\n\nan inexperienced moron, and Andy Warstar is great regardless.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a5b0700fcd8dc6ebd3cddf65a967fba1cbde4cc","amp;dn":"Andy+Warstar+-+06%2F19%2F07+Melbourne%2C+Oz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a5b0700fcd8dc6ebd3cddf65a967fba1cbde4cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,91,7,0,252,216,220,110,189,60,221,246,90,150,127,186,28,189,228,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
