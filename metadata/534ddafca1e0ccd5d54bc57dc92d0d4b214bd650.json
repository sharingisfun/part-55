Combined, they play instruments ranging from 3 kinds of keyboards, saxophone, clarinet, various hand-held percussion nd a full drum set.\n\nSo these two guys sample their own music and assemble them into a pretty sweet set.  It&amp;#039;s amazing to think that the output only comes from two people.\n\nCheck them out!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:534ddafca1e0ccd5d54bc57dc92d0d4b214bd650","amp;dn":"Dosh+-+Wolves+and+Wishes+%282008%29+%5BMP3+192kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"534ddafca1e0ccd5d54bc57dc92d0d4b214bd650","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,77,218,252,161,224,204,213,213,75,197,125,201,45,13,75,33,75,214,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
