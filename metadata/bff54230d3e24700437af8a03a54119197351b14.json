It was released October 15, 1996, on Ani DiFranco&amp;#039;s label, Righteous Babe Records.\n\nThe album consists of recordings of Utah Phillips telling stories at concerts that have been set to musical background by Ani DiFranco. There are no songs as such on the album, and DiFranco only provides background vocals on the first and last tracks as part of her remixing efforts.\n\nThe album was followed by Fellow Workers, a second collaboration between Phillips and DiFranco, which focused on Union songs associated with the Industrial Workers of the World and contained singing as well as spoken word pieces.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Past_Didn%27t_Go_Anywhere&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Past_Didn%27t_Go_Anywhere&lt;/a&gt;\n\n01 - Bridges.mp3\n02 - Nevada City, California.mp3\n03 - Korea.mp3\n04 - Anarchy.mp3\n05 - Candidacy.mp3\n06 - Bum On The Rod.mp3\n07 - Enormously Wealthy.mp3\n08 - Mess With People.mp3\n09 - Natural Resources.mp3\n10 - Heroes.mp3\n11 - Half A Ghost Town.mp3\n12 - Holding On.mp3\n\n\n\n                                                       (Alien Invader)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bff54230d3e24700437af8a03a54119197351b14","amp;dn":"The+Past+Didn%5C%27t+Go+Anywhere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bff54230d3e24700437af8a03a54119197351b14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,245,66,48,211,226,71,0,67,122,248,160,58,84,17,145,151,53,27,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
