The vinyl was centralized which means there was absolutely no side to side movement of the tone arm. This is usually the major flaw with vinyl as it causes a &quot;WOWING&quot; effect noticable to most audiophiles. It is usually caused by the hole not being entirely central and is more annoying than the occasional click in my opinion. Also in use on the Dual 505 Record Deck was a Platter Pad which no user of vinyl should be without. It enhances the sound no end!\n\nPlease re-seed for other music lovers.\n\nRescue Me\nJust Another Day\nStay With Me Baby\nLove Is Blind\nAre You Ready For This\nYou\\&amp;#039;re The Loser\nIt\\&amp;#039;s Coming Right\nChippin\\&amp;#039; Away At The Stone\nIn The Arms Of Someone Else\nFallin\\&amp;#039;\n\nRoll The Dice\nLookin\\&amp;#039; For Love\nHold On To Love\nKeep A Little Love In Your Heart\nWho D\\&amp;#039;Ya Think You\\&amp;#039;re Foolin\\&amp;#039;\nHonesty &amp; Emotion\nOnly In A Dream\nRide The Wind\nNo Pretending\n\nHypnotised [Bonus Track - Brian Connolly solo single prod. &amp; feat.

The band recorded three albums with CBS Records and toured Europe before disbanding. Rodford joined the Kinks, John and Bob joined Charlie, to record an album with RCA Records. John produced the Phoenix albums and Charlie album as well as the first Saxon album.\n\nDuring the early 1980s Verity worked with Brian Connolly (former vocalist with Sweet) in an attempt to launch him as a solo artist. A single, \\&quot;Hypnotised\\&quot; was released on Carrere Records in 1982 produced by Verity and written by Joe Lynn Turner of Rainbow fame. Verity was part of Connolly\\&amp;#039;s backing band Encore when they supported Pat Benatar at the beginning of 1983. The line up of this band formed the basis of Verity\\&amp;#039;s own band, imaginatively entitled Verity which went on release several albums including \\&quot;Interrupted Journey\\&quot;.\n\nHe frequently plays with his band in and around Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire. He also has many acoustic gigs as a duo with either Max Milligan or Mark Griffiths as well as with the band. The usual line up features Bob Henrit on drums and Mark Griffiths on bass.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2dbcc03470b06b33aaf3adc857b486d66f030995","amp;dn":"Verity+-+Interrupted+Journey+%2F+Truth+Of+The+Matter+%5Bex-ARGENT%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2dbcc03470b06b33aaf3adc857b486d66f030995","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,188,192,52,112,176,107,51,170,243,173,200,87,180,134,214,111,3,9,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
