Normally films that aim at becoming cult hits tend to fail miserably ? they strain far too much for the qualities that simply come organically out of authentic cult hits and end up satisfying neither the mainstream nor the underground. Bad Boy Bubby is a rare exception. It&amp;#039;s blatantly obvious that director Rolf De Heer was making the film as weird as he possibly could, but yet it all seems to fit together as a whole.\n    The story deals with a 35 year old man who, much like the protagonist of Herzog&amp;#039;s film, has been kept completely out of touch with the outside world. Raised by a perverted mother, who uses him as a sexual surrogate for his absent father, he is incapable of functioning on any level other than mimicry ? he imitates words, phrases and expressions from the few people he comes into contact with and has no sense of how to function in society. When he finally leaves the safety of his prison/home, he experiences the joys of a day to day &amp;#039;normal&amp;#039; existence. What De Heer does very well in the film is to show just how strange and out of synch these mundane elements are to Bubby ? whether it be tasting his first slice of pizza or hearing his first rock and roll song..\n    Nicholas Hope does a superb job in the lead. While superficially the sort of role an actor would kill for, I can&amp;#039;t imagine too many mainstream stars being willing to take this particular project on. Bubby is in literally every scene and the story is told through his eyes, but he has some potentially off-putting things to do along the way.\n    De Heer doesn&amp;#039;t shy away from showing him having sex with his middle aged mother, and he even gets to commit a few murders. This isn&amp;#039;t a genteel, &amp;#039;cute&amp;#039; portrayal of mental retardation a la Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man or Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump ? he may initially seem to be a caricature, but Bubby grows as a character as the film unfolds and it&amp;#039;s a monumental task, ultimately, to make him believable and compelling as a protagonist. Hope accomplishes all of this brilliantly, ably demonstrating a flair for comedy as well as an ability to generate genuine pathos. The supporting cast does fine work as well, but nobody is able to compete with Hope&amp;#039;s mesmerizing performance.\n    Bad Boy Bubby isn&amp;#039;t a perfect film ? due to its loose structure, it tends to ramble and De Heer does manage to go a little overboard in some of his excesses ? but it is a compelling, funny, occasionally moving and undeniably memorable experience.\n\nBob foi obrigado pela mÃƒÂ£e a viver atÃƒÂ© os 30 anos fechado num cubÃƒÂ­culo imundo, sem ver a luz do sol e mal sabendo falar, mantendo inclusive relaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂµes sexuais incestuosas.

O filme ÃƒÂ© uma reflexÃƒÂ£o sobre o papel do homem na sociedade moderna, perdido entre valores morais e culturais decadentes. AlÃƒÂ©m da produÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o impecÃƒÂ¡vel e de um certo humor, o ator Nick Hope foi o melhor de 1993 segundo o Instinto Australiano de Cinema.
