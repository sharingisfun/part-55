She was named IGN Comic&amp;#039;s &quot;Hottest Comic Book Babe&quot; in 2005, ranked #21 on IGN Comic&amp;#039;s &quot;Top 25 X-Men&quot; in 2006 and took 69th place on WizardÃƒÂ¢??s 200 Greatest Characters of All Time List in 2008 ranking way ahead of some of the more prominent members of the X-Men.\n\nAn urbane, mutant telepath with a well-noted dry wit initially known as the White Queen (complete with revealing white attire for which she is known), Frost has changed from one of the X-Men&amp;#039;s more infamous foes to one of their most prominent members.\n\nShe was originally one of the wealthy, mutant elites who composed the Inner Circle of the Hellfire Club. There she led the clubÃƒÂ¢??s junior team, the Hellions. The death of the entire squad was a turning point in her life. Haunted by her failure with one group of students, she joined Charles XavierÃƒÂ¢??s cause to mentor another, the X-Men junior team Generation X. Later, after the mutant haven of Genosha was destroyed, she joined the X-Men. Her controversial relationship with constant leading X-Man Cyclops and sometimes ruthless dedication to the next generation of mutants resulted in her assumption of duties as headmistress of the Xavier Institute.\n\nIn August 2003, writer Karl Bollers penned an ongoing series showcasing her origins titled Emma Frost. This is it. The series, which lasted for 18 issues, began during her days as a private school student and ended before her days as a Hellfire Club member. It introduced her father Winston as well as her brother Christian, also exploring the early days of her two sisters Adrienne and Cordelia.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb5a9d31f6d121535466ac86dd7c7e67f141e98c","amp;dn":"Emma+Frost+-+Comics+by+Karl+Bollers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb5a9d31f6d121535466ac86dd7c7e67f141e98c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,90,157,49,246,209,33,83,84,102,172,134,221,124,126,103,241,65,233,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
