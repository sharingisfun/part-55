The JEMS crew neither authorized nor approved this rip, and I apologize profusely if this bothers them in any way.  JEMS has already stated that they intend to release their own CD-friendly versions of their DAT masters in the near future.  I would expect that, when they do, anyone who wasted their bandwidth downloading these files will delete them in favor of the real version from JEMS.\n\nI did not indicate track splits for either date.  Make your own.  I do not know what split JEMS would give these.\n\nBoth dates had a few imperfections such as drops or noise.  I corrected all instances that I found.  So that makes these files unauthorized remasters as well as  unauthorized rips.\n\nDo NOT sell this material anywhere!  Giving copies away or trading copies is good for your karma.  Selling this material makes you worthless scum. Of course, if you are the kind of person who does not care that someone would think of you as worthless scum, then you already are worthless scum.\n\nDo NOT give or trade this material in anything less than the current Apple Lossless audio quality.  FLAC is fine, but MP3 sucks!  These files are already dramatically reduced in quality from their DVD audio source.  Don't make them any worse!\n\nDO obtain the origial DVD audio versions of these shows!  They are far superior to the CD quality rips.
