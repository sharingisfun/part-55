Unlike Scorched Earth however, it is available for free in its entirety. Also, Scorched 3D adds, amongst other new features, a 3D island environment and LAN and internet play. Scorched 3D is a open source game for both Microsoft Windows and Unix (Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, Solaris, etc.) operating systems.\n\nThe first build was created in April 2001 by lead developer Gavin Camp. The idea for the creation of Scorched 3D was revealed in an interview with Gavin on The O&amp;#039;Reilly Network:\n\n    Scorched Earth was an institution for me and my friends at university. On many nights we used to play the game while drinking ÃƒÂ¢?? although it is pretty good even without the drink. Recently on a boring flight I played it with friends for eight hours straight; we hardly noticed the time passing. I thought that Scorched in 3D would allow many more game concepts, and [it] also combined my love of 3D graphics with the classic game.[3]\n\nScorched 3D originally started as a 3D landscape generator. It was eventually converted into a game, early on, and development continues to this very day with the project being hosted by SourceForge.net. The current stable version is v41.3 which fixes some performance issues in version 41, and balances some weapons effects. Version 41 brought many improvements to the game such as real time shadows and improved water effects.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:466544dc56134e86045292c817e80a57cba7e937","amp;dn":"Scorched3D-41.3%282%29.exe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"466544dc56134e86045292c817e80a57cba7e937","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,101,68,220,86,19,78,134,4,82,146,200,23,232,10,87,203,167,233,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
