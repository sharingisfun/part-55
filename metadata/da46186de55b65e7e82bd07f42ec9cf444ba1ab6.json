It&amp;#039;s the same great Boston sound as the first Boston album.\nA must-have for any Boston fan. \nOne of the best albums nobody remembers or has heard of. \n\nEnjoy! ? please comment ? and seed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da46186de55b65e7e82bd07f42ec9cf444ba1ab6","amp;dn":"Barry+Goudreau+-+former+guitarist+of+Boston+-+1980","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da46186de55b65e7e82bd07f42ec9cf444ba1ab6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,70,24,109,229,91,101,231,232,43,208,127,66,236,156,244,68,186,26,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
