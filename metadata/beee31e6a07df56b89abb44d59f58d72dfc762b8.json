DVD RIP\n\n\nLooking for a rousing Viking adventure that\\\\\\&amp;#039;s cheesy and entertaining? The Long Ships is just the movie for you. As England\\\\\\&amp;#039;s greatest color cinematographer, Jack Cardiff had filmed 1958\\\\\\&amp;#039;s The Vikings, so he was well-prepared to direct this exciting, occasionally grisly mini-epic (a British/Yugoslavian coproduction, filmed in Yugoslavia), which received mixed-to-favorable reviews when released in 1964. Back then, it was a perfect matinee marvel if you were young and impressionable, and it\\\\\\&amp;#039;s still worth its weight in hot buttered popcorn. While that most contemporary of actors, Richard Widmark, is clearly out of place as a maverick Norse warrior, he\\\\\\&amp;#039;s sufficiently valiant as he guides his Viking brother (Russ Tamblyn, still hot from West Side Story) and a long-ship full of warriors in search of a huge, solid-gold bell coveted by Mansuh (Sidney Poitier), a Moorish prince obsessed with retrieving the legendary bell at any cost. Treacherous maelstroms, lovely damsels, corny battles, and casual humor make The Long Ships a lot of fun--like a Ray Harryhausen adventure without the animated creatures.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:beee31e6a07df56b89abb44d59f58d72dfc762b8","amp;dn":"THE+LONG+SHIPS+%281964%29++VIKING+ADVENTURE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"beee31e6a07df56b89abb44d59f58d72dfc762b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,238,49,230,160,125,245,107,137,171,180,77,89,245,141,114,223,199,98,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
