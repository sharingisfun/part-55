One of the topics of this show was Spiricom, an attempt to communicate electronically with the dead by George Meek, Bill O&amp;#039;Neill, and an alleged ghost by the name of Doc Mueller.  This research generated controversy but this was its first debut in an (arguably) mainstream radio talk show in the USA.  If you want to know more about Spiricom, the site is www.worlditc.org.  Nowadays, you can check out search terms like &quot;ghost box&quot; or &quot;Frank&amp;#039;s box.&quot;\n\nCommercials, station IDs cut.  Everything else is exactly as it was broadcast.\n\nShare and enjoy.\n\n-bleach-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d083b7820cd22c296c9673a97a96fa5d91009ca7","amp;dn":"Ghost+to+Ghost+Halloween+2004+ghost+stories+-+art+bell%2C+spiricom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d083b7820cd22c296c9673a97a96fa5d91009ca7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,131,183,130,12,210,44,41,108,150,115,169,122,150,250,93,145,0,156,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
