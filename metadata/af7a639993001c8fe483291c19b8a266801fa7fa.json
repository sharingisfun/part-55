BushÃƒÂ¢??and Bush Agenda adherents plan for it to outlast him.\n\nJuhasz uncovers the history and key role of U.S. corporations in the creation of this agendaÃƒÂ¢??focusing on Bechtel, Lockheed Martin, Chevron, and HalliburtonÃƒÂ¢??then presents the Iraq War as its most brutal application to date. Expertly revealing the oil timeline driving the war, Juhasz charts exactly how the administration has fundamentally transformed Iraq\\&amp;#039;s economy, locked in sweeping advantages to its corporate allies, and expanded its target to the whole Middle East. The results of these same corporate globalization policiesÃƒÂ¢??dislocation, extreme poverty, and increased violence and terrorismÃƒÂ¢??have been demonstrated in regions from South America to Africa to the Middle East and Asia, and in the United States.\n\nExtensively researched and now updated with a new afterword, The Bush Agenda is a brilliant, informative analysis, revealing the hard truths about where the Bush administration and its corporate allies are leading the modern worldÃƒÂ¢??and what we can do about it.\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nAntonia Juhasz is a leading expert on international trade and finance policy and a visiting scholar with the Institute for Policy Studies.
