As a bonus  some of his classics have been re-recorded\n and reworked into a 2K8 outfit giving them a proper sound and mixing. From a\n chilling opening movie anthem to solid trance mixed with true anthemic melodies\n to even an experimental beats track.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb6067438a0639e767109b28bbe9ac013baabf10","amp;dn":"Airwave+-+Touareg+-WEB-2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb6067438a0639e767109b28bbe9ac013baabf10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,96,103,67,138,6,57,231,103,16,155,40,187,233,172,1,59,170,191,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
