Good Quality! One of the best movies of the 90s!\n\nPlot: The film follows William Gates and Arthur Agee, two African-American teenagers who are recruited by St. Joseph High School in Westchester, Illinois, a predominantly white high school with an outstanding basketball program. Taking 90-minute commutes to school, enduring long and difficult workouts and practices, and acclimatising to a foreign social environment, Gates and Agee struggle to improve their athletic skills in a job market with heavy competition. Along the way, their families celebrate their successes and support each other during times of hardship.\nThe film raises a number of issues concerning race, class, economic division, education and values in contemporary America. It also offers one of the most intimate views of inner-city life to be captured on film. Yet it is also the human story of two young men, their two families and their community, and the joys and struggles they live through over a period of five years.\n\nFrom: xBAJMx\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b06c3eefeb9384bd18c56b58fc55cd5f54eb88f1","amp;dn":"Hoop+Dreams","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b06c3eefeb9384bd18c56b58fc55cd5f54eb88f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,108,62,239,235,147,132,189,24,197,107,88,252,85,205,95,84,235,136,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
