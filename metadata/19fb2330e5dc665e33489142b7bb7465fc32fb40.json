Please leave feedback.\n\nFixed &quot;About this Mac&quot; crashing Finder on some AMD machines. Again leave feedback if it is still crashes for you.\n\nImproved Nvidia graphics support with updated kexts. Even my 8800 GTS 512 works with these. Still try at your own risk.\n\nAdded a script that is installed to the root of you directory called RemoveVideo. With this you can easily remove the video kexts should a problem arise. Simply boot into single user mode with the bootflag -s at the Darwin prompt. Type:\n/sbin/fsck -fy\n/sbin/mount -uw /\n./RemoveVideo\nThen type exit to continue booting. \n\nIf you choose no video driver options all video kext&amp;#039;s are removed except ATINDRV.kext, this one is used by Software Updates to verify the Leopard Graphics update is applied. You will have to manually remove this one if needed.\n\nOptimized directory structure and repaired prebindings to help seek times for some people. Should be a little quicker now.\n\nPlease visit http://osx86leo4all.wikidot.com for additional support","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19fb2330e5dc665e33489142b7bb7465fc32fb40","amp;dn":"Leo4Allv1-PPF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19fb2330e5dc665e33489142b7bb7465fc32fb40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,251,35,48,229,220,102,94,51,72,145,66,183,187,116,101,252,50,251,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
