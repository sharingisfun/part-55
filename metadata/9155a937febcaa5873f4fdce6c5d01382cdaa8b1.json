Best of all, they follow the chord progression that you have entered, so that you hear an authentic audio accompaniment to your song.\n\nMultiStyles - WeÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ve added MultiStyles to Band-in-a-Box.  These are Styles that can have anywhere from 4 to 24 substyles!  Previous Band-in-a-Box Styles were limited to 2 substyles (ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½aÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ and ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½bÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½).  Now, for example, a MultiStyle with 4 substyles (First Verse, Verse, Chorus, Break) can be used, and you select the various sections using A, B, C &amp; D part markers.  Some of our newest Styles Sets are MultiStyles, typically with 4 substyles, but some Techno Styles have 24 substyles. \n\nAudio Chord Wizard Enhancements - The Audio Chord Wizard is the amazing feature that automatically figures out the chords from MP3 files (or other audio files like WAV, WMA, and audio CD etc.).  The Audio Chord Wizard is a great way to learn and practice popular songs, as you play along and see the chords.
