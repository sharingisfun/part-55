It uses a wing-in-ground-effect concept to skim low over the water at high speeds. The Lun, Russian for &amp;#039;Dove&amp;#039;, is also one of the largest aircraft ever built, rivalling the size of the Spruce Goose. This aircraft is fitted with six fixed-elevation SS-N-22 Sunburn anti-ship missile launchers.
