It is a remake of Counter-Strike, the 1999 modification of Half-Life. Built on the Source engine, the game was released in 2004 along with Half-Life 2. As of February 28, 2008, the game is the most played Half-Life 2 mod, according to GameSpy.[1]\n\nAs in the original version, Counter-Strike: Source games pit a team of counter-terrorists against a team of terrorists in a series of rounds. Each round is won by either completing a mission (such as detonating a bomb or rescuing hostages) or by eliminating all members of the opposing team. Unlike Half-Life: Source, the game is a complete remake instead of a port with additional content.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f30aff54670bf7c317735afddd468ecdfc52e2f4","amp;dn":"%5BPC+Game%5D+Counter+Strike%3A+Source+%28%2B+Patch+v7%29+-%5BOAQO%5D-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f30aff54670bf7c317735afddd468ecdfc52e2f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,10,255,84,103,11,247,195,23,115,90,253,221,70,142,205,252,82,226,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
