My group chose to create a Linux \n                 task management application, but none of us had any GUI \n                 experience in Linux. Over the course of the next few days I \n                 created these videos to show everyone a way to do it so that \n                 we could work independently. The test project is a simple GUI \n                 calculator that performs basic arithmetic. These videos start \n                 with nothing but a blank text document and ends with a fully \n                 functional calculator. Package and installation videos are \n                 also included. If you?re not a hard core coder these videos \n                 will bore you to tears! But there is some great information \n                 in there.\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= Video List -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\nVideo 1        : Software Installation\nVideo 2        : Looking At The Software\nVideo 3        : Coding The Calculator Class\nVideo 4        : Class Functions: Part 1\nVideo 5        : Class Functions: Part 2\nVideo 6        : Class Functions: Part 3\nVideo 7        : Class Functions: Part 4\nVideo 8        : Testing Our Code\nVideo 9        : Designing the GUI: Part 1\nVideo 10       : Designing the GUI: Part 2\nVidel 11       : KDevelop: Part 1\nVideo 12       : KDevelop: Part 2 - Linking Number Buttons\nVideo 13       : KDevelop: Part 3\nVideo 14       : KDevelop: Part 4\nVideo 15       : KDevelop: Part 5\nVideo 16       : How To Install Our Program\nVideo 17       : How To Uninstall Our Program\nVideo 18       : How To Make RPM\nVideo 19       : How To Install RPM\n/* ************************************************************************** */\n/* ***************************** About WiBit.Net **************************** */\n/* ************************************************************************** */\nWiBit was a website used by college students (and one professor) from Towson \nUniversity in Baltimore, Maryland as a repository for learning materials. The\nsite creators were former Computer Science and Computer Security students, \nKevin Willett and Bryan Stouffer. The first WiBit Tutorials were created by \nKevin as a study aid for himself in late 2003. Over the following years Kevin\nand Bryan decided to create a few tutorials and give themselves and their\nfellow students a place to view and use them. Some were used as presentation\naids and students teaching students seminars. Over 30 tutorials were created!\nThe WiBit Tutorials served themselves well! All the students involved in the\nproject became professionals in their field of study. The creators Kevin and \nBryan currently develop medical software. Others are working for great \ncompanies such as Bowing and Lockheed Martin. Since college the need to \ncreate tutorials has died down, but who knows what the future holds!\n\nKevin can be reached at: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;06767469716a63746d626546616b676f6a2865696b&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n/* ************************************************************************** */\n/* *************************** We Hope You Enjoy! *************************** */\n/* ***************** (-: IF YOU LIKE, PLEASE SEEEEED!!! :-) ***************** */\n/* ******************************* It&amp;#039;s Legal ******************************* */\n/* ************************************************************************** */","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:031ff52d9ca684844c6e1fbf778248be777d0747","amp;dn":"WiBit.Net+Video+Tutorial+-+Linux+GUI+C%2B%2B+Project","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"031ff52d9ca684844c6e1fbf778248be777d0747","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,31,245,45,156,166,132,132,76,110,31,191,119,130,72,190,119,125,7,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
