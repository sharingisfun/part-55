He lives with his girlfriend Betty (Beatrice M.) in a small Berlin flat. Pictures of centerfold models and serial killers decorate the walls. Human body parts are neatly displayed, floating in formaldehyde, sealed in glass jars. Rob adds to his collection daily, much to Betty&amp;#039;s delight.\n\nNot content with body parts alone, Rob surprises Betty by presenting her with a bloated corpse pulled from a swamp. Betty is overjoyed, and with the rotten corpse between them, they pledge undying love\n\nEncoded with DVD-shrink.
