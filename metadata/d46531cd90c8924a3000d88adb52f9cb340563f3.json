Queen Elephantine&amp;#039;s formidable contributions to those records were weighty works themselves, but a mere sampling of what they could do on their own. Surya&amp;#039;s five tracks stretch out to over an hour, as the band lives up to its name and presents a perfect soundtrack to the unwieldy march of a mystical elephant caravan across the celestial plains. They melt down the sounds of Black Sabbath, Sleep, Hawkwind, Pink Floyd, early Monster Magnet, and a variety of other influences into a cosmic swamp all their own, populated by droning numbers like the self-titled lead off track and lumbering epics such as the 16-and-a-half-minute &quot;Ramesses II,&quot; which rumbles along almost religiously with its chanted lyrics and smoky atmosphere until the pace picks up for its swirling climax.\n\nThe Middle Eastern influence of the instrumental &quot;Kabir&quot; provides a trippy interlude before &quot;Plasma Thaw&quot; swings in on a monstrous groove reminiscent of the usual suspects from the &amp;#039;70&amp;#039;s and doesn&amp;#039;t let up, definitely the catchiest song on the album. &quot;Bison&quot; closes the record at a mammoth 27 minutes and 24 seconds, an expansive sonic journey that never gets boring or monotonous. The layers upon layers of hypnotic rhythms and molasses riffs, enhanced by the jammed-out feeling throughout Surya should please fans of bands like Sons of Otis, Mammatus, Acid Mothers Temple, Ufomammut, and Om. The band is still in search of a record label to release the album as a physical entity, rather than its current digital format, but Queen Elephantine won&amp;#039;t be denied for long as they continue their trek to the throne of heavy space-rock royalty.\n\n\nHellride Music:\nQueen Elephantine is a group of young explorers in the world of heavy psychedelia, and ÃƒÂ¢??SuryaÃƒÂ¢?? is their first full-length, coming hot on the heels of various split releases and such in the past year or two. ÃƒÂ¢??SuryaÃƒÂ¢?? is a long, contemplative trip into the world of inner visions, a journey in which the devotional merges with the visionary to stake out a unique corner of the musical underground.\n\nÃƒÂ¢??SuryaÃƒÂ¢?? begins with ÃƒÂ¢??Queen Elephantine,ÃƒÂ¢?? a lurching, meditational drone with plenty of heavy, distorted bass; a recipe the group uses to its advantage throughout the album. The song builds very slowly, offering visions that are somehow relaxed yet filled with anxiety, bringing to mind a space voyage with a crash landing on a far planet, where the alien sands drift quietly over blurry shapes both bizarre and sinister. ÃƒÂ¢??Ramesses IIÃƒÂ¢?? is a desert mirage of jerky military rhythms and monks offering devotional chanting that builds into the wails of lost souls. ÃƒÂ¢??Plasma ThawÃƒÂ¢?? is more rawkinÃƒÂ¢??, while the 27+ minute ÃƒÂ¢??BisonÃƒÂ¢?? is as thunderous as its namesake, with leaving-the-rails blues-based thrashing reminiscent of English cult doom/sludge outfit Ramesses. This tune pushes Queen Elephantine territory out further, with various plodding sludgy riffs creating a claustrophobic blues hell colonized by nasty Tibetan demons of every des c r i p tion.\n\nLovers of heavy psychedelic doom or drone as manifested by groups as wide-ranging as Sleep, Acid MotherÃƒÂ¢??s Temple, Mammatus, YOB, and even ÃƒÂ¢??SaucerÃƒÂ¢??-era Floyd should climb aboard with these young musicnauts. ItÃƒÂ¢??s not a comfortable or easy trip by any means, but it will reward your (lysergic) attention.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d46531cd90c8924a3000d88adb52f9cb340563f3","amp;dn":"Queen+Elephantine+-+Surya+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d46531cd90c8924a3000d88adb52f9cb340563f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,101,49,205,144,200,146,74,48,0,216,138,219,82,249,203,52,5,99,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
