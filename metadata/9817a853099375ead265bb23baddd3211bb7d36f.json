Most of the episodes are pretty good quality but there are a few that aren\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;t the best. Still its a great anime series and can be at times really deep. \n\nBasically this Japanese high school student, Light Yagamai, finds this small notebook , with it he finds that he can take a human lives away. For the rest, you have to watch the show!\n\nPlease enjoy this, I will probably be seeding for some time. If, however, you need more seeders please let me know.\nAlso I won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;t respond to stupid things like \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; SEEEEEEEEEEEED \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;. Be intelligent in your questions.\n\nAlso the music is really good!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9817a853099375ead265bb23baddd3211bb7d36f","amp;dn":"Death+Note+Episodes+1+-+36+%28w%2FEnglish+Subtitles%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9817a853099375ead265bb23baddd3211bb7d36f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,23,168,83,9,147,117,234,210,101,187,35,186,221,211,33,27,183,211,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
