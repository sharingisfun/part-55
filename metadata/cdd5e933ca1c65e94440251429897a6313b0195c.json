The Sontarans raid the station, killing almost all aboard. They capture the second Doctor and take him to Earth, imprisoning him in a hacienda near the Spanish city of Seville. There Dastari, also in league with the Sontarans, plans to dissect him in order to find the Rassilon Imprimature - the symbiotic nuclei within a Time Lord\\&amp;#039;s genes that are the key to time travel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdd5e933ca1c65e94440251429897a6313b0195c","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+-+141+-+The+Two+Doctors+-+DVD+%28PAL%29+BBCDVD1213","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdd5e933ca1c65e94440251429897a6313b0195c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,213,233,51,202,28,101,233,68,64,37,20,41,137,122,99,19,176,25,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
