Unbeknowest to both of them, the woman, named Larn by Ken, is a vampire. When her relatives find and reveal the awful truth to her, she flees from Ken, despite having falling hopelessly in love with him. Ken is adamant about winning his lover back from her kins and willingly risks his own life to find her in the vampires&amp;#039; lair.\n\nThe story of a vampire and a man, Koo Tae Song Loke is a touching, though very clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© and predictable, story. The effects were good for the time period in Thailand, but watching it now, in the age of Lord of the Rings and Spider-Man, it does seem very cheesy and somewhat cheap. Thai actors can&amp;#039;t really act, so don&amp;#039;t expect too much from that department. The acting in this movie as well as other Thai ones tend to be either too much or way too little. The bad guys seem to always overact, perhaps fearing that the evil they are supposed to portray won&amp;#039;t be fully depicted. This is definitely the case of the vampires, the relatives of the main girl. Their facial expressions are too exaggerated. This can get somewhat annoying from time to time. The good people always act like they can&amp;#039;t act. May be they really can&amp;#039;t, I don&amp;#039;t know. The girl, Larn, is a fine example of this. Don&amp;#039;t get me wrong.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85b5473741bf009770f10dcdc751ba97e52be35b","amp;dn":"%5BThai+Movie%5D+-+Koo+Tae+2+Lhok+-+1994+%2Fengl.subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85b5473741bf009770f10dcdc751ba97e52be35b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,181,71,55,65,191,0,151,112,241,13,205,199,81,186,151,229,43,227,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
