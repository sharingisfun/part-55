While the band took a small rest from non stop touring and recording 1995 he released a solo record where he covered some of the musicians and bands who where the biggest influence on him and his career. This is the only solo record he made. This is not really Indochine for those who looks for that kind of music but more a layed back relaxed versions of different songs  in English and French. Its a really nice homage to some of the biggest artists and he does it with lots of respect and love. Its really worth listening to.\n\n   1. Waterfront (David Sylvian)\n   2.
