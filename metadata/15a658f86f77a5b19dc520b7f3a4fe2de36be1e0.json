Included are instructions and scripts. The instructions also explain how the files were created and how you can repeat the process if you want to.\n\nThis setup also works in the stock andLinux (www.andlinux.org) and enables you to develop Cell applications in widnows, without installing VirtualBox or VMWare.\nChange the andLinux default to use at least 512 mb if you plan on using the Cell simulator for debugging. Resize the disk to at least 4gb. Do NOT try to install this on a CoFs mapped drive (that is make sure all files are on an andLinux partion).\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15a658f86f77a5b19dc520b7f3a4fe2de36be1e0","amp;dn":"Complete+Cell+SDK+on+Ubuntu+Gutsy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15a658f86f77a5b19dc520b7f3a4fe2de36be1e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,166,88,248,111,119,165,177,157,197,32,183,243,164,254,45,227,107,225,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
