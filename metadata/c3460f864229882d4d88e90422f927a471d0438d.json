But eight years and 20 million albums and singles later, here he is with a greatest hits package so stuffed with songs--15 in all--that it doesn&amp;#039;t have room for any new tunes, or even the best of all, &quot;Everywhere.&quot; \nMcGraw&amp;#039;s appeal is two-fold: Aside from his unlistenable duets with wife Faith Hill and the abysmal &quot;Indian Outlaw&quot; that jump-started his career, he&amp;#039;s had excellent taste in songs. And he&amp;#039;s the epitome of the average guy in search of extraordinary love--the loser who becomes a winner. You see it all here, in the hate-it-but-love-it &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Take the Girl,&quot; the adrenaline rush of &quot;Something Like That,&quot; and the infectious &quot;I Like It, I Love It.&quot; If this album doesn&amp;#039;t give hope to every karaoke singer in America, nothing will.\n\n\nInformation Disc:\n\n?
