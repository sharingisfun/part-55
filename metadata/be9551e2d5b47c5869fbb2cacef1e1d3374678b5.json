Sounds good, no? Oh, and did I mention that they hail from Spain? Jeez, the country is hardly a hub of Black Metal activity, but if this band is anything to go by then the French and Finns should watch their leather-clad backs. Quite simply, ÃƒÂ¢??The Last Breath Of My Mortal DespairÃƒÂ¢?? is essential listening for all fans of psychotic extreme music. Take a deep breath, turn the volume up to 11 and scan the horizon for the four horsemen of the apocalypse. Can you tell that IÃƒÂ¢??m utterly enthusiastic about ÃƒÂ¢??The Last Breath Of My Mortal DespairÃƒÂ¢???\n\n \n\nNow, this is no easy listen ÃƒÂ¢?? The atmosphere of this album is suffocating in itÃƒÂ¢??s unswerving depressiveness, the guitars shift between searing riffing and haunting melodic interludes, the vocals alone might cause your ears to bleed and the hailstorm of tempo shifts (subtle as they sometimes may be) ensures there is a lot to take in, but it all sounds like it should be that way. It doesnÃƒÂ¢??t come off as pretentious or haranguing to the listener. These Spanish denizens of the deep have definitely mastered their *(depressive) art, delivering another excellent slab of suicidal Black Metal that throws more than a passing glance at technicality. With the exception of the second track, which is a pointless interlude, this album is a keeper from start to finish, whether itÃƒÂ¢??s the brooding DEATHSPELL OMEGA worship of ÃƒÂ¢??The Horrible Drawing Back Of The VeilÃƒÂ¢?? or the DARKTHRONE/HORNA gallop of ÃƒÂ¢??Owner Of WailingsÃƒÂ¢??. Oh, and the title track features a random divebomb solos that absolutely kills me. That shit, on a Black Metal album?! Hell yessss. But really, this band has managed to capture that unearthly grim and maniacal sound of ÃƒÂ¢??Dictius Te NecareÃƒÂ¢?? era BETHLEHEM, mesh it with DEATHSPELL OMEGAÃƒÂ¢??s progressive tendencies, while adding epic PRIMORDIAL vibes when needed. So yeah, thereÃƒÂ¢??s a lot to take in but youÃƒÂ¢??ll enjoy every damn second of it. Spanish Black Metal is alive!\n\nVery good album.\n\n(Online April 30, 2008)\n\nv2 VBR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be9551e2d5b47c5869fbb2cacef1e1d3374678b5","amp;dn":"Empty+-+The+Last+Breath+Of+My+Mortal+Despair+%282005%29+%2ASpanish+BM%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be9551e2d5b47c5869fbb2cacef1e1d3374678b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,149,81,226,213,180,124,88,105,251,178,202,206,241,225,211,55,70,120,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
