After assisting Julius Caesar in a string of military campaigns, Augustus is adopted by the Roman leader, and when Brutus and Cassius kill Julius, Augustus joins forces with Marc Antony to rid them and their associates of the Roman leadership. As Augustus becomes Rome\\&amp;#039;s new and uncontested leader, he falls for the beautiful Livia and is forced to turn against Marc Antony on the field of battle. While Rome enjoys a period of wealth and progress, Livia becomes politically ambitious and Augustus finds he has become the center of an assassination plot. Augustus stars Peter O\\&amp;#039;Toole and Charlotte Rampling, who respectively portray the mature Augustus and Livia. -","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c00574a33da5b221ecfac1eb6205d96c3698680","amp;dn":"Augustus%28ENG%29PAKG-dvdrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c00574a33da5b221ecfac1eb6205d96c3698680","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,0,87,74,51,218,91,34,30,207,172,30,182,32,93,150,195,105,134,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
