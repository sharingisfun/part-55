There is no multilevel merchandising plan or handcuffing DRM?only high-quality, haunting music.\n\nWhile essentially electronic, this isn&amp;#039;t glitch, house, dance, trance, industrial, or eighties.  This isn&amp;#039;t experimental, it&amp;#039;s empirical becoming fact.  Fake stands apart, with stylistic influences stretching far and wide without imitation or mindless repetition?not of its inspirations, and not of itself. \n\nThis album comes with a heavily illustrated PDF book, written in the style and tone of 1960&amp;#039;s era US Government pamphlets, with instructions on how to live your life.\n\nThe torrent contains high-quality mp3s.  There is a preview of the album here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.fakeproject.com/you_are_not_dead/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.fakeproject.com/you_are_not_dead/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou&amp;#039;re invited to check it out. We doubt disappointment.\nThanks for downloading. D. Reetz and M.
