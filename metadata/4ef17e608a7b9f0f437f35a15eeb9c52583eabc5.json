Over the course of several recordings each, they?ve brought\na little imagination to the traditions they?ve inherited. This time Simmons?\nguilt-laden souls aren?t wrestling with heaven and hell so much as romance, and\nCockrell has released the spiritual uplift that?s been bubbling beneath the\nsurface all along.\n\nNot that the two sound alike or even espouse the same beliefs, but they both\nmake country-influenced music and have church-going in their blood?Simmons grew\nup in the Church of Christ denomination, and Cockrell is the son of a Southern\nBaptist minister. And both just released new recordings that explore new\nspiritual directions.\n\nGod and the devil loom large on Simmons? first two proper releases. A desperate\ndualism haunts Last Call, and most of the characters in the 16 songs poison\ntheir relationships with dirty hands and guilty consciences. Follow-up Drink\nRing Jesus bores beneath the surface in duels between good and evil to\ncompelling and insightful results?there?s even a song written from the devil?s\nperspective on reeling in a soul on ?Devil?s Work Is Never Done.? On both\nalbums, Simmons injects the urgency of the pulpit, mined from his experience\ngrowing up in Woodbury, Tenn., into storylines of down-and-out folks.\n\n?Half of the service was [the preacher] sweating and spitting out fire and\nbrimstone,? Simmons says. ?It would get so hard that people [were] moved to get\nup and go down front, and that meant everybody was going to be late for lunch,\nbecause somebody hadn?t been true and they would tell what they?d done. Maybe\nthere?s something cathartic about going [to the altar]. Maybe everybody else is\nlike, ?OK, I feel much better now. We got that out of the way?let?s go eat.? ?\n\nHe got so used to that sort of fervency that he expected it most everywhere. ?I\nremember moving and going to a really big church somewhere on West End and\nfeeling kind of ripped off because nobody chewed me out,? he says.\n\nSimmons? latest, Something In Between, isn?t about spiritual wrestling so much\nas sorting through the rubble of relationships. It?s as if, for the moment, he?s\npurged the thoughts of hellfire from his system.\n\n?You write a lot more songs about relationships?or most people do?than you do\nabout demons and stuff like that,? he says. ?For a long time, it was tied really\nclosely to those themes. I don?t know if that?s just that phase I was going\nthrough. Anybody that absorbs all that stuff?I think you have to work it out\nsomehow.?\n\nBut not surprisingly, Simmons? relationship songs have a soul-searching element\ntoo. ?I think sometimes it?s the same theme of guilt and learning how to forgive\nyourself when you haven?t lived up,? he says. Take ?Go Easy On Me,? a\nstraight-ahead heartland rock song that beseeches whomever might be listening to\n?Go easy ?cause I?m trying / Can?t make up for the last time / Couldn?t fix it\nif I tried.?\n\nIt may seem like Simmons has followed a direct route away from spiritual\npreoccupations, but the timeline?s not that simple. Never intending the\ndemo-like Drink Ring Jesus to be a full-fledged album, Simmons ended up slipping\nit in between Last Call and the then-in-progress Something In Between. ?I\nremember thinking, ?Wow, I just went even one more step off that cliff on the\nreligion thing with [Drink Ring Jesus], so when I do get this [new] one out it?s\ngoing to really seem like I completely swung back around,? he says.\n\nEven across different subject matter, Simmons? songwriting has a ragged realism\nand human empathy from album to album. A lot of the scenes unfold in bars or\nbedrooms. His voice has a rubbed-raw quality and his melodies scrape the earth.\n\n?Even on the stuff that deals with spirituality?I definitely feel more\ncomfortable with the word ?spirituality? than ?religion??there?s not anything\nthat?s even slightly judgmental, because that?s what I kind of cringe [at] about\nmainstream religion?the judgmental aspect?having felt guilty and been made to\nfeel guilty for a long time,? Simmons says. ?But I?m a part of that too?you have\nto want to be made to feel guilty.?\n\n?Obviously [songs] still come out like that,? he says. ?It?s not like you\ncompletely move away from it.?\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ef17e608a7b9f0f437f35a15eeb9c52583eabc5","amp;dn":"Stephen+Simmons+-+Something+In+Between+%5B2008%2FVBR%5D-404","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ef17e608a7b9f0f437f35a15eeb9c52583eabc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,241,126,96,138,123,159,15,67,127,53,161,94,235,156,82,88,62,171,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
