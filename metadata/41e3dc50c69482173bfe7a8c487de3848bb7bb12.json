Never forcing a preconceived notion of &quot;fusion,&quot; the band has let their music coalesce over the past four years, and it&amp;#039;s already turning heads worldwide. Their debut album earned them an International Acoustic Music Award - before it was even released.\n\nMillish is united by a single musical goal: to participate in the evolution of modern music. Judging by their accolades, they&amp;#039;re well on their way.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41e3dc50c69482173bfe7a8c487de3848bb7bb12","amp;dn":"Millish-MIllish","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41e3dc50c69482173bfe7a8c487de3848bb7bb12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,227,220,80,198,148,130,23,59,254,122,140,72,125,227,132,139,183,187,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
