Biohazard at their peak! Great Quality. Enjoy!\n\nFrom: http://www.discogs.com/label/Imtrat\n\nImtrat released a bunch of unauthorised but legal (because of loopholes in the german copyright-law, which left, simply said, foreign live-recordings of foreign artists unprotected) recordings of concerts and radio-shows. The series &quot;Live &amp; Alive&quot; included recordings of such different artists as The Who, Whitney Houston, Ozzy Osborne, David Bowie, Madonna, Elvis Presley and many others. After the Imtrat release of &quot;Phil Collins Live USA&quot; Phil Collins&amp;#039; record company Warner Music filed a lawsuit against them, which finaly ended in a change of copyright laws in Germany and other european countries and the disappearence of Imtrat.\n\nBiohazard - Live&amp;Alive (Rare Printed Bootleg) - Live in U.S.A. 1993 Cd Info at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/release/1264228&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/release/1264228&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEncoded @ 320kbps\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4222dd58d72f595374b75cf8661dba4616532387","amp;dn":"Biohazard+-+Live%26Alive+%28Rare+Printed+Bootleg%29+-+Live+in+U.S.A.+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4222dd58d72f595374b75cf8661dba4616532387","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,34,221,88,215,47,89,83,116,183,92,248,102,29,186,70,22,83,35,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
