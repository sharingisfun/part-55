He and his friend, Alberto Granado are typical college students who, seeking fun and adventure before graduation, decide to travel across Argentina, Chile, Peru, Colombia, and Venezuela in order to do their medical residency at a leper colony. Beginning as a buddy/road movie in which Ernesto and Alberto are looking for chicks, fun and adventure before they must grow up and have a more serious life. As is said in the film itself, it&amp;#039;s about &quot;two lives running parallel for a while.&quot; The two best friends start off with the same goals and aspirations, but by the time the film is over, it&amp;#039;s clear what each man&amp;#039;s destiny has become.\n\nDirector:        Walter Salles\n\nCountry:  Argentina | USA | Cuba | Germany | Mexico | UK | Chile | Peru | France \n\nTransfer Format: 1080p \n\nYear:            2004\n\nRunning Time:    126 min \n\nIMDB:           &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318462/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318462/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFinalcodec Player \n\ndownload                                                                     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.siluhd.com/soft/FinalCodecs2008sp.exe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.siluhd.com/soft/FinalCodecs2008sp.exe&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou need a powerfull computer to play VC-1 codec HD\nRecommended: INTEL Core2 DUO or AMD X2 4800+ and ATI 2400 PRO\n\nOther movies visit                                                                          \n\n               &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/accpt7506_siluer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/accpt7506_siluer&lt;/a&gt;\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf5fe19e0d8ae14d6a55cb9c960651185cf1e1d2","amp;dn":"The.Motorcycle.Diaries.2004.HD-DVD.REMUX.VC-1.1080P.DTS-HDMA.%40Si","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf5fe19e0d8ae14d6a55cb9c960651185cf1e1d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,95,225,158,13,138,225,77,106,85,203,156,150,6,81,24,92,241,225,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
