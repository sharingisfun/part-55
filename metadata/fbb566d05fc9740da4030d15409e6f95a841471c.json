Even as Buttercup herself is \n\nkidnapped by a giant, a scheming criminal mastermind, \n\nand a master Spanish swordsman, a mysterious masked \n\npirate (could it be Westley?) follows in pursuit. As they \n\nsail toward the Cliffs of Insanity...\n  The wild and woolly arcs of the story, the sudden \n\ntwists of fate, and, above all, the cartoon-scaled \n\ncharacters all work because of Goldman's very funny \n\nscript, Reiner's confident direction, and a terrific cast. \n\nElwes and Wright, both sporting their best English \n\naccents, juggle romantic fervor and physical slapstick \n\neffortlessly, while supporting roles boast Mandy Patinkin \n\n(the swordsman Inigo Montoya), Wallace Shawn (the \n\nincredulous schemer Vizzini), and Christopher Guest \n\n(evil Count Rugen) with brief but funny cameos from \n\nBilly Crystal, Carol Kane, and Peter Cook.\n\n  Starring: Cary Elwes, Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin, \n\nChris Sarandon, Christopher Guest, Wallace Shawn.\n\n  Directed by: Rob Reiner.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 38min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 688 x 432","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbb566d05fc9740da4030d15409e6f95a841471c","amp;dn":"The+Princess+Bride+%281987%29+%28Cary+Elwes%2C+Robin+Wright%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbb566d05fc9740da4030d15409e6f95a841471c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,181,102,208,95,201,116,13,164,3,13,21,64,158,111,149,168,65,71,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
