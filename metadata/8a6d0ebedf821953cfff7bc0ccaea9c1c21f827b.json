And all this in parallel I still called it &quot;Trance&quot; to give the music style a well-known face (now, Trance changes a lot at the moment!). But it gets more difficult. Today both Matt Darey and Gianluca Motta are playing everything from Trance to Techno, NeoTrance, House, Progressive (a lot), Minimal, Electro, Rocktronica, Breaks. Wow. Maybe I should rather describe the artists in a different way. Gianluca Motta's set is located in the triangle between Paul van Dyk, deadmau5 and Moby while Matt Darey's style also adds some deadmau5 elements but is otherwise his own. Both sets are very nice and you have to like them! Period!!\n\nApart from that, the Nocturnal Podcast has been nominated for the award as Best Podcast at the Winter Music Conference! A special high quality version of the newest Podcast #11 is available on TMB [HERE]\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nMatt Darey - [ Trance / Progressive / Electro / Rocktronica]  \n\n01.

The undecoded MP3 files were cut with mp3DirectCut, optimized with mp3packer (removing a buffer underrun of frame &quot;0&quot;) and MP3val (correcting the MP3-file length reported by the MP3 header for proper seeking). Foobar2k was used to add ID3-tags, to avoid clipping by scaling the Global Gain to 89dB and to add ReplayGain tags. Final quality (TMB HQ): 192kbps 44.1kHz VBR stereo MP3.  All MP3-players will play the files as usual. After all the optimizations, a third (for normal stereo mp3-players invisible) channel with 32-48kbps 5.1 surround extension has been added with the MP3SX converter. This results in a final bitrate for both sets of 224-256kbps. Check the Fraunhofer explanations HERE.
