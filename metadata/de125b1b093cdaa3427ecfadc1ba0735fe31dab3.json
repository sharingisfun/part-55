Place was a lot darker then, than it is now - crowd of about 150ppl jammed in this tiny joint. Smoky and hot and gnarly, this concert scared the living shit out of me. i\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;ve seen banyan several times since and they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;re always extremely exciting; this moment in time, though... bad-ass. hope you like. go to their concerts. buy their stuff. they pay serious dues. plz be patient with my limited seeding ability, i\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;ll be on at least every day for a few hours, usually daytime mountain time.\n\nFeaturing:\nStephen Perkins: drums\nWillie Waldman: trumpet\nMike Watt: bass\nNels Cline: guitar\n\nenjoy...\n\nLRonHoover\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de125b1b093cdaa3427ecfadc1ba0735fe31dab3","amp;dn":"Banyan+Live+%28mp3%29+2002-Feb-19%2C+Bozeman%2C+MT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de125b1b093cdaa3427ecfadc1ba0735fe31dab3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,18,91,27,9,60,218,163,66,126,207,173,193,186,7,53,254,49,218,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
