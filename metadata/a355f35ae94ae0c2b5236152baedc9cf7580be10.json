Now for the first time films like \\&quot;Eolomea\\&quot;, \\&quot;Signals\\&quot; and \\&quot;Stardust\\&quot; are featured on this present album. The highlights from their original scores -spiced by exquisite titles from a long gone &amp; obscure Amiga tribute to Sigmund Jaehn, the first German in Kosmos!(...) can be found here.\nEnjoy soundtrack-world-premieres featuring spacy music by the well-known composers Karl-Ernst Sasse &amp; Guenther Fischer plus Amiga 1969 hit single \\&quot;Kosmos\\&quot; plus lots of dialogue highlights and sound effects! With the CD comes an additional medley of former GDR pioneer-hymns and more dialogue parts.\n\nBelieve it or not - the communists liked space-operas, too.\nOf course: The eastern bloc created milestones in science-fiction like the novels of Stanislaw Lem or the films by Andrej Tarkowskii (\\&quot;Stalker\\&quot;, \\&quot;Solaris\\&quot;) which ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ not at last ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ were responsible for the boom of this genre. But who knows about the DEFA-equivalents of HollywoodÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s more entertaining sci-fi series or Western German tv-serials like \\&quot;Star MaidensÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½? Well, here we go: This is exactly what \\&quot;Kosmos!ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ is about!\nDespite being determined anti-capitalistic, the DEFA science-fiction movies also (carefully) criticized the so called \\&quot;real-existing socialismÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ in the former GDR. In contrast to the more action-orientated productions from outside the eastern bloc, the essence of these films could be summed up in the question of how socialist ideas can be realized in \\&quot;space-communitiesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ far away from earth.\nWith Karl-Ernst Sasse and Guenther Fischer (from their scores to the popular DEFA-western movies -&gt; ASM 002 and ASM 008) the two most dominating composers of filmmusic in the GDR are responsible for the extraordinary soundtracks to these movies. Opposite to their western movie scores, their music for the science-fiction movies was pretty different from what you are used to hear in the \\&quot;capitalisticÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ science-fiction movie. From strictly-avantgardistic orchestral sounds over electronic experiments to cosmic waltzes, beat guitars and influences of \\&quot;KrautrockÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½. Thereby it sometimes sounds so fresh as if it has been produced in some new-electronic sound-laboratory right these days. Somehow strange sound the titles from the Amiga-LP \\&quot;Die Erde dreht sich linksherum!\\&quot; featuring e.g Stern-Combo MeiÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½en and the Guenther-Fischer-Quintett.\n\nThe CD comes with 12 page booklet. Contains detailed English and German linernotes, film biographies, some lyrics and many film stills.\n\t\nKosmos: Soundtracks Of Eastern Germany\\&amp;#039;s Adventures In Space\nClick to enlarge\n\nTrack listing:\n\n01 Kosmos\n02 Meteoritenschwarm\n03 B-Alarm\n04 Die Erde GrÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t Euch Kosmonauten &amp; Main Title\n05 Im Staub der Sterne - Das Licht - Part 1\n06 Wir rufen die Venus\n07 Raum-Orgel\n08 Sklaven-Ballett\n09 Wir rufen Luna 3\n10 Orbit Swing\n11 Warum schweigt die Venus?\n12 Eolomea\n13 Variation\n14 Hier Luna 3...\n15 Party TEM 4 [Part 1]\n16 Blues\n17 Luna 3 ruft Kosmokrator\n18 Party TEM 4 [Part 2]\n19 Party TEM 4 [Part 3]\n20 Raum-Walzer\n21 Luna 3-Sonnenreflektor\n22 Juana &amp; Terry\n23 Schluss\n24 Im Staub der Sterne - Der Mensch - Part 2\n25 Finale\n26 Outro\n27 In den Kosmos\n28 Hoch im All\n29 Kosmoslied\n30 Nie wieder Kosmos\n31 Sounds And Dialogues\n32 Kosmos-Marsch\n33 GruÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ den KosmonautenbrÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼dern (Pioniere-Medley)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a355f35ae94ae0c2b5236152baedc9cf7580be10","amp;dn":"va+-+2001+-+soundtracks+of+eastern+germanys+adventures+in+space+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a355f35ae94ae0c2b5236152baedc9cf7580be10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,85,243,90,233,74,224,194,181,35,97,82,186,237,201,207,117,128,190,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
