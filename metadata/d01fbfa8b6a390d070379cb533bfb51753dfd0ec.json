Insurance investigator Reardon pursues the case against the orders of his boss, who considers it trivial. Weaving together threads of the Swede\\\\\\&amp;#039;s life, Reardon uncovers a complex tale of treachery and crime, all linked with gorgeous, mysterious Kitty Collins.

Director Robert Siodmak took the original Ernest Hemingway short story as its opening point and developed it in an elaborate series of flashbacks. Remade for television in 1964 by director Don Siegel (\\\\\\&quot;Dirty Harry\\\\\\&quot;), but it was deemed too violent for America\\\\\\&amp;#039;s living rooms and got a theatrical release instead. \n\n\nDirected by: Robert Siodmak","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d01fbfa8b6a390d070379cb533bfb51753dfd0ec","amp;dn":"THE+KILLERS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d01fbfa8b6a390d070379cb533bfb51753dfd0ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,31,191,168,182,163,144,208,112,55,156,181,51,191,181,23,83,223,208,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
