She began her career as a child star in vaudeville, and later went on \nto write her own plays, including &quot;SEX&quot;, for which she was arrested. Though her \nfirst movie role was a small part in Night After Night (1932), her scene has \nbecome famous. A coat check girl exclaims, &quot;Goodness! What lovely diamonds!&quot;, \nafter seeing Mae&amp;#039;s jewelry. Mae replies, &quot;Goodness had nothing to do with it&quot;. \nHer next film, in which she starred, came the following year. She Done Him Wrong \n(1933) was based on her earlier and very popular play, &quot;Diamond Lil&quot;. She went \non to write and star in seven more films, including My Little Chickadee (1940) \nwith W.C. Fields. Her last movie was Sextette (1978), which also came from a \nplay. She died two years later.\nIMDb Mini Biography By: Carla Donnell \n\n\nMini Biography\nMary Jane West was born in Brooklyn, New York, on August 17, 1893, to parents \ninvolved in prizefighting and vaudeville. Mae herself worked on the stage and in \nvaudeville from the time she was five years old. She never was academically \ninclined because she was too busy performing. She studied dance as a child, and \nby the time she was 14 she was billed as &quot;The Baby Vamp&quot; for her performances on \nstage. Later Mae began writing her own plays. One of those plays, &quot;Sex&quot;, landed \nher in jail for ten days on obscenity charges in 1926. Two years later her play \n&quot;Diamond Lil&quot; became a huge Broadway success. Mae caught the attention of the \nHollywood studios and was given her first movie role with George Raft in Night \nAfter Night (1932). Although it was a small role, she was able to display a wit \nthat was to make her world-famous. Raft himself said of Mae, &quot;She stole \neverything but the cameras.&quot; The moviegoing public fell in love with the first \nwoman to make racy comments on film. She became a box-office smash hit, breaking \nall sorts of attendance records. Her second film, She Done Him Wrong (1933), was \nbased on her earlier and popular play that she had written herself. The film was \nnominated for an Academy Award as Best Picture. It also made Cary Grant a star. \nHer third film later that year was I&amp;#039;m No Angel (1933). The controversy aroused \nby these two films resulted in the studios establishing the Motion Picture \nProduction Code, which regulated what content could be shown or said in \npictures. As a result of these codes, Mae began to double-talk so that a person \ncould take a word or phrase any way they wished. This was so she could get her \nmaterial past the censors, and it worked. She really felt she had a vested \ninterest because it was her written work being scrutinized. She had already \nwritten and performed these for the stage with the very material now being \nfilmed. Her next film, Belle of the Nineties (1934), was an equal hit. By 1936, \nwith Klondike Annie (1936) and Go West Young Man (1936) she became the highest \npaid woman in the US. After 1937&amp;#039;s Every Day&amp;#039;s a Holiday (1937), she didn&amp;#039;t make \nanother film until 1940, when she co-starred with W.C. Fields in another film \nshe wrote herself, My Little Chickadee (1940). It was well known she had little \nuse for Fields and his ways, which were crude ven for her. After The Heat&amp;#039;s On \n(1943), Mae took a respite from the film world, mainly because the censors were \ngetting stricter. She decided she would be able to have greater expression in \nher work if she went back to the stage. Mae continued to be a success there. \nWhen censorship began to end in the 1960s, she returned to film work in 1970&amp;#039;s \nMyra Breckinridge (1970). MYRA Her last film was 1978&amp;#039;s Sextette (1978). Mae \nsuffered a series of strokes which finally resulted in her death at age 87 on \nNovember 22, 1980, in Hollywood, California. She was buried in New York. The \nactress, who only appeared in 12 films in 46 years, had a powerful impact on us. \nThere was no doubt she was way ahead of her time with her sexual innuendos and \nhow she made fun of a puritanical society. She did a lot to bring it out of the \ncloset and perhaps we should be grateful for that.\nIMDb Mini Biography By: Denny Jackson \n\n\nSpouse\n      Frank Wallace(11 April 1911 - 23 July 1942) (divorced)\n\n\nTrivia\nHollywood&amp;#039;s outrageous, self-proclaimed psychic Criswell predicted in 1955 that \nshe would win the 1960 Presidential election, and would fly to the moon in 1965 \nwith him and friend Liberace!.\nAfter two years of denying that she had ever been married, West admitted in a \nreply to a legal interrogatory in 1937 that she and Frank Wallace had married in \n1911.
