You must have a patched ISO already with the MD5: 293f82f9624eadd49baee70e19d68adc\n\nNew Leo4All.ISO MD5 checksum after applying the patch should be:\n\n6d4e68afb3486baec03b446fb0a5d711\n\nChanges/Fixes:\n\nImproved ATI and GMA950 graphics support with updated kexts. There are some new options here so take a look. For ATI I added new installers for 2600PRO/2600XT/3850/3870/3870X2. Now GMA950 has an option that will install Vanilla 10.5.2 kexts and Natit.\n\nUpdated the RemoveVideo script, now it will ask you what type of video card so it only removes the corresponding kexts. Simply boot into single user mode with the bootflag -s at the Darwin prompt. Type:\n/sbin/fsck -fy\n/sbin/mount -uw /\n./RemoveVideo\nFollow the prompt to choose type of card.\nThen type exit to continue booting. \n\nCorrected an issue with some PS2 keyboards on laptops not working(I hope)\n\nAdded the latest Time Machine and Security Updates into the installer.\n\nAdded Quicktime 7.4.1 update.\n\nAdded option to choose Vanilla 9.2.2 kernel.\n\nUpdated AppleSMBIOS to latest version by Netkas.\n\nRemoved APIC option(Now the installer uses this older ACPIPlatform and AppleAPIC by default)\n\nAdded new Applications: Unison, Pacifist, KextHelper\n\nAdded support for some Marvell PATA chipsets, for those ICH9 users that requested it. Choose the ICHx fixed IOATAFamily.kext\n\nSystem Profiler should be working as intended now for everyone.\n\nBy request I changed out the AppleIntegratedFramebuffer.kext\n\nModified the default ACL package, this may speed the install a little for some. It is down to under 15 minutes total for me!\n\nThe plan is to post a new ISO up tomorrow some time for those that don\\&amp;#039;t already have it downloaded.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:699212451ef26ecb21058a61a6d0370c1d164fb1","amp;dn":"Leo4Allv2-PPF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"699212451ef26ecb21058a61a6d0370c1d164fb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,146,18,69,30,242,110,203,33,5,138,97,166,208,55,12,29,22,79,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
