Just D/L it by yourself at http://www.magiciso.com/download.htm...\n\n\nThe Package contains the Setup, the Patch, a first version of the program made portable w/ the batch file that launches the program converted to an EXE with QBFC to avoid showing the relative DOS window, but that some AVs see sometimes as a virus. If your AV is one of them, or if you don&amp;#039;t trust too much to it, use the second one that runs directly the batch file. You will have the sloppy DOS window in the background but less complaints from antiviruses...\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:922383d1d8035c5dc5e5dbf97875d3c277e42378","amp;dn":"MagicISO+v5.5+Build+261+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"922383d1d8035c5dc5e5dbf97875d3c277e42378","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,35,131,209,216,3,92,93,197,229,219,249,120,117,211,194,119,228,35,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
