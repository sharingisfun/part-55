In August 2000, Mojo magazine voted &quot;I Can&amp;#039;t Make You Love Me&quot; #8 on its The 100 Greatest Songs Of All Time list.[1]\n\nA pensive ballad, &quot;I Can&amp;#039;t Make You Love Me&quot; was recorded against a quiet electric piano-based arrangement, with prominent piano fills and interpolations supplied by Bruce Hornsby. \n\nThe song was a big hit for Raitt, reaching the Top 20 of the U.S. pop singles chart and the Top 10 of the Adult Contemporary chart, and helped solidify her remarkable late-in-career commercial success that had begun two years before. In the time since, &quot;I Can&amp;#039;t Make You Love Me&quot; has gone on to become a pop standard and a mainstay of adult contemporary radio formats.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57acd8fe5dedecd597eba8552a8565705cee3fee","amp;dn":"Bonnie+Raitt+-+I+Can%5C%27t+Make+You+Love+Me","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57acd8fe5dedecd597eba8552a8565705cee3fee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,172,216,254,93,237,236,213,151,235,168,85,42,133,101,112,92,238,63,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
