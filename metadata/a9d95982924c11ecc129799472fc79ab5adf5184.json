I love this album. If it doesn&amp;#039;t get you first time, give it a few listens ... it&amp;#039;s great. \n\nThis is ripped from good quality centralized vinyl (original Cherry Red LP). I haven&amp;#039;t heard the Angel Air CD version which the reviewer was writing about. Maybe the tapes had deteriorated over the years prior to CD release. At least the vinyl version was using Master Tapes only a few years old.\n\n\nTrouble With Women \nAny Port in a Storm \nLady Don&amp;#039;t Fall Backwards \nHigh Noon \nLay Down Your Love \nWaves of Love \nElectric Chair \nWon&amp;#039;t You Give Him One (More Chance)\nOne More Chance to Run [Bonus Track - Original Album Version]\n\n\n\nLet me know what you think of this album. I hope you enjoy it.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9d95982924c11ecc129799472fc79ab5adf5184","amp;dn":"British+Lions+-+Trouble+With+Women+%5BMott%2FMedicine+Head%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9d95982924c11ecc129799472fc79ab5adf5184","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,217,89,130,146,76,17,236,193,41,121,148,114,252,121,171,90,223,81,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
