Not that the lyrics revolve around her stomping grounds of Malibu and Ventura County, but her mellow \nmelodies sound like products of those places (co-writer Jason Reeves&amp;#039; ukulele playing reinforces the beach music impression). \nInstead, Caillat sings about love in all its guises, as on &quot;Capri,&quot; a tribute to a mother-to-be. The daughter of audio engineer Ken Caillat (Fleetwood Mac&amp;#039;s Rumours), who provides production assistance, Colbie combines acoustic pop, light jazz, and blue-eyed soul on Coco. Despite her young age--22 at the time of its release--the record seems likely to attract an older audience, although her sunny singing manages to sound centered and spirited at the same time. Coco doesn&amp;#039;t offer anything startlingly new, but its relaxing vibe is hard to resist.\n\n\nInformation Disc:\n\n? Artist:  Colbie Caillat\n? Title:   Coco\n? Year:    2007\n?
