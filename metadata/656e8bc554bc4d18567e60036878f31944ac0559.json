Rather pleased at the feedback I&amp;#039;m getting thus far; thanks for the positive comments. I know that a lot of people are going to dislike a lot of the things I have here, because there were 758 songs, and I&amp;#039;m sure everyone could pick out different favourites. However, I like to think that I hit the nail on the head at least every once in a while, and you all end up with something that you didn&amp;#039;t have before, which is the reason that you&amp;#039;re downloading this compressed version of the SXSW Playlist and the reason that I downloaded and listened to the whole thing. Your list:\n\n1.Exodus Honey-Honeycut\n2.Crime Does Pay-The Hourly Radio\n3.Wine Red-The Hush Sound\n4.House Up On The Hill-Ian Moore\n5.In This City-Iglu and Hartly\n6.Julia, We Don&amp;#039;t Live In The 60&amp;#039;s-The Indelicates\n7.Inside and Outside-Intuitive Music Orchestra\n8.Out Come The Wolves-Jacob Golden\n9.Cheney&amp;#039;s Toy-James McMurty\n10.Faster Than Cars Drive-Kate Tucker and The Sons of Sweden\n11.Muscle Hair-Kevin Shields\n12.10,000 Lakes-Kid Dakota\n13.Misadventures of the Campaign Kids-King of Prussia\n14.What We Wanted-Krief\n15.Restless-Langhorn Slim\n16.Robot Ponies-Laura Barrett\n17.We Are Gods! We Are Wolves!-Le Loup\n18.Nascent Part I-Leslie Keffer\n19.Punch Balls-Lexie Mountain Boys\n20.Cherry Chapstick-Lil&amp;#039; Cap&amp;#039;n Travis\n21.Let&amp;#039;s Get Crazy-Limbeck\n22.On My Chest(Remix)-Lissie\n23.The World Should Revolve Around Me-Little Jackie\n24.Japanese Candy-Little Teeth\n25.Coup D&amp;#039;Etat-Lord T and Eloise\n\n\nA few notes:\n-Muscle Hair might sound a tad abrasive to some people\n-Intuitive Music Orchestra is awesome\n-On My Chest is currently an obsession of mine; I&amp;#039;ve probably listened to it five or six times today already\n-Some of these artists have things coming out later this year, and you won&amp;#039;t be able to find anything from them other than this. Lissie is among them(if she&amp;#039;s not, please tell me. Please). So take advantage, and if you find something that you love but can&amp;#039;t find more of, welcome to my nightmare.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:656e8bc554bc4d18567e60036878f31944ac0559","amp;dn":"Best+of+The+SXSW+Playlist%2C+Part+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"656e8bc554bc4d18567e60036878f31944ac0559","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,110,139,197,84,188,77,24,86,126,96,3,104,120,243,25,68,172,5,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
