Enjoy.\n\nPlease seed after download. Thanks ÃƒÂ¯??\n\n\nBy \tfelicitaz &quot;felicitaz&quot; (NY, USA) \n\nI saw this series as a child, and it profoundly influenced my life, making me an eager historian and costumer ever after. Just a year or so ago, my brother gave this series to me as a gift, and it is even better than I remembered it. \n\nThe reign of the Tudors followed the War of the Roses, a bloody, chaotic part of British history, characterized by civil war and royal asassinations. The two little princes in the Tower, murdered by order of Richard III, were Henry VIII&amp;#039;s uncles. His father, Henry VII, ended the strife by defeating Richard III, and marrying the Yorkist heir, Elizabeth. Their union brought stability to England. \n\nYou have to keep these events in mind when watching this series, because they make Henry VIII&amp;#039;s actions understandable. His seemingly monomaniacal need for a son was his effort to ensure that nothing like the War of the Roses would happen again. \n\nThis series is for the serious Tudor buff. It comes from the era of BBC productions that were richly intellectual, subtly acted and true to the original material. Also, looking at it again after so many years, I realize what a parade of first class British actors participated: Annette Crosbie, Dame Dorothy Tutin, Patrick (&quot;Dr. Who&quot;) Troughton, Bernard Hepton, and even Mollie (&quot;Are You Being Served&quot;) Sugden. \n\nKeith Michell delivers a Henry VIII whom you can hate and yet sympathize with--very human, sometimes weak, sometimes funny. He is a scholar, musician, knight, statesman, victim, tyrant, penitent, cuckold, and philosopher, as events dictate. His Henry is very complex; and one of the pleasures of this production is that you find yourself watching to see which Henry is going to emerge. One can imagine that his wives and courtiers also walked on eggshells, not knowing which facet of his personality might turn itself in them at any given time. \n\nOf the six episodes: \n\nCATHERINE OF ARAGON: Though Catherine is my favorite of the wives, I don&amp;#039;t think this is the best episode, because it has to cover over 25 years of history in a few hours. Annette Crosbie does a fine job of portraying the proud, honorable Catherine. She even resembles portraits of the amber-haired princess. This should really have been 2 episodes. What is there is excellent. What&amp;#039;s missing is more of Catherine&amp;#039;s large part in the govenment of the realm, a more thorough characterization of Wolsey, of Catherine&amp;#039;s father Ferdinand&amp;#039;s duplicity, and how both of them in their different ways helped undermine her relationship with Henry. It&amp;#039;s a pity Catherine was short-changed in this series, because she&amp;#039;s the most interesting of the wives--the only woman Henry VIII really feared, and the only one who could have taken his throne away from him, had she chosen. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9daf6088533e06273ee9757dc54664e535a4bb24","amp;dn":"The+Six+Wives+of+Henry+the+VIII+-+BBC+1970","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9daf6088533e06273ee9757dc54664e535a4bb24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,175,96,136,83,62,6,39,62,233,117,125,197,70,100,229,53,164,187,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
