Fact is, Chicago 21 has about three or four hits on it but not so as you&amp;#039;d be able to tell.  The album disappeared the moment it left the door -- if I hadn&amp;#039;t have had a sober moment my last year of college I would have missed it.  How hard is this album to find?  Used copies sell for around $10 on EBay.  That&amp;#039;s not too bad and indicates it&amp;#039;s pretty rare, since you can pick up a copy of 20 for 1 cent.\n\n\n\nThe album contains:\n\n\nExplain It To My Heart\n\nIf It Were You\n\nYou Come To My Senses\n\nSomebody, Somewhere\n\nWhat Does It Take\n\nOne From the Heart\n\nChasin&amp;#039; the Wind\n\nGod Save the Queen\n\nMan to Woman\n\nOnly Time Can Heal the Wounded\n\nWho Do You Love\n\nHoldin&amp;#039; On\n\n\n\nVOTE CHICAGO INTO THE HALL OF FAME!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a42b25740a476f53a2111021981a1ff9f802e7f0","amp;dn":"Chicago+21+%28XXI%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a42b25740a476f53a2111021981a1ff9f802e7f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,43,37,116,10,71,111,83,162,17,16,33,152,26,31,249,248,2,231,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
