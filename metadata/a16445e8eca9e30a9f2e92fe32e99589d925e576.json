Many think that Marian Keyes leads a glitzy life of limos, television, and showbiz parties - but she would argue that she spends the majority of her life writing alone, wearing her PJs, and eating bananas with a laptop on a pillow in front of her. Under the Duvet is a wide collection of her journalism and stories - all personal, closely observed, and painfully funny. I have again used Tunebite to copy the Audible file and remove the protection....Further Under the Duvet to follow. Enjoy and remember to seed this one so that others get the chance to enjoy it, and please leave feedback /comments.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a16445e8eca9e30a9f2e92fe32e99589d925e576","amp;dn":"UndertheDuvet+%5BMarian+Keyes%5D+Unabridged_mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a16445e8eca9e30a9f2e92fe32e99589d925e576","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,100,69,232,236,169,227,10,159,46,146,254,50,233,149,137,217,37,229,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
