Without much fanfare, he released this debut album in 1994, only to witness a groundswell of critical acclaim as he drew favorable comparisons to Bob Marley.   It&amp;#039;s easy to see why he would be compared to Marley; his singing voice, his delivery, his upbeat yet poignant tone, his female background singers, and his straightforward roots style are all eerily similar.  Still, I can&amp;#039;t help but think that when someone like Fontaine emerges who carries a sound so close to Marley&amp;#039;s, and he doesn&amp;#039;t stink (and Fontaine certainly does not), people seem to praise him a bit more than they should, more than they would if he didn&amp;#039;t pacify their overwhelming craving for more Marley music.  Fontaine certainly has a formidable task ahead of him proving that he&amp;#039;s not riding Marley&amp;#039;s decades-long coattails.  Reggae Power is a solid start in the right direction.  The quality here is consistently good, though not dazzling, throughout.  Tracks 3 and 4 , &quot;Africa We Love&quot; and &quot;Jah Won&amp;#039;t Forsake I,&quot; are the standouts; they hold their own even when compared to Marley.  The rest is decent, but certainly not up to Marley&amp;#039;s standards, which unfortunately is whom Fontaine will likely be compared to in many listeners&amp;#039; eyes.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2783eababce4af110c715b30ef35a8df7735aef9","amp;dn":"nasio+fontaine-+reggae+power","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2783eababce4af110c715b30ef35a8df7735aef9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,131,234,186,188,228,175,17,12,113,91,48,239,53,168,223,119,53,174,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
