vista 32-bit:\n\nAll software in this package have been released for free by their authors, and have been downloaded from their original servers.\n\nUsing cracked software means using viruses and Trojans as your means of security.\nCracked anti-virus applications do not scan for viruses designed by the cracker, and cracked firewalls will always have a couple of back doors open \nfor the author and his sponsors to come and visit.\n\nDO NOT BECOME A SLAVE OF THE BOTNET, SECURE YOURSELF FROM CRACKED SOFTWARE!\n\n\nBEST Installation order:\n\n1.AVG anti-virus OR Comodo Anti-virus\n2.Comodo BOClean Anti-Malware\n3.Lavasoft Ad-aware 2007\n4.Peerguardian OR Protowall\n5.Firefox and it&amp;#039;s plugins\n6.COMODO Firewall Pro 3\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTIONS:\n\nAVG anti-virus 7.5\n-----------------\n\nAVG is a decent anti-virus application.\nIt&amp;#039;s no kaspersky, but it&amp;#039;ll do the job for free.\n\nYou can download AVG 8.0 at : http://free.grisoft.com/ww.download?prd=afe\n\n*But be aware, 8.0 may look nicer then 7.5, but it is essentialy the same, but with more forced ads worked into it.\n\nsource: http://free.grisoft.com\n\n\nComodo Anti-virus 2.0\n----------------------\n\nVery detailed and fully configurable.. just like kaspersky.. but free!\n\nsource: http://www.comodo.com\n\n\n\nComodo BOClean Anti-Malware\n----------------------------\n\nThis application will protect your system 24/7 from all kinds of Malware.\n\n\nsource: http://www.comodo.com\n\n\nU.S. Lavasoft Ad-aware 2007\n----------------------------\n\nFor all your basic annual adware scans.\n\n*I advice you all to do a fast basic scan with this software every time prior you are about to buy something over the Internet.\nIt will always catch that last keylogger you thought you were free off.\n\n\n\nSOURCE: http://www.lavasoftusa.com/\n\n\n\nComodo personal firewall 3\n---------------------------\n\nThis firewall is quit amazing, and absolutely free. \nIf improperly configured it will nag you to death with stupid connection requests, but on the overall scale \nit&amp;#039;s a good product.\nIt&amp;#039;s pretty designed, and does not slow your shit down like some other firewalls did in the past.\n\n\nSource: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.comodo.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.comodo.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPeerguardian 2  (probably not vista compliant)\n---------------\n\nUse peerguardian to secure your Internet connection and filter out bad peers.\nPeerguardian is free (open-source) and uses free Internet updated IP block lists to filter out Time Warner, sony and other company&amp;#039;s from \nconnecting to your computer and prosecuting you later on with the facts that you have been sharing their shit!\nAlso filter out Anti-P2P company&amp;#039;s sending out corrupts data to the torrent hive to slow shit down. \n(plus governmental and educational institutions, advertising and reported malicious servers.)\n\n\nFAQ:\n\n*Some people are having trouble updating Peerguardian, in this case you can disable it whilst updating and then enable it again after it finished.\n\n*Don&amp;#039;t forget to configure your peerguardian to either not log your connections or at least delete your logs everyday. \n(if peerguardian will continue to log without removal of the log, after a couple of months you&amp;#039;ll have a log of about 1 GB, and that will slow your shit down!)\n\n*When changing configuration settings within peerguardian, shutdown peerguardian after completion of your actions and restart the application. \n(this will ensure your configuration changes have been written down in the configuration file)\n\n\n\nSource: http://phoenixlabs.org/pg2/\n\n\n\nProtowall 2.0.1 Build 9 (probably not vista compliant)\n------------------------\nDoes the same as peerguardian, but is not as popular.\n\nsource: http://www.bluetack.co.uk/\n\n\n\n\nPEER FILTERING IN VISTA.\n-------------------------------------------\nI Have added information in a special folder for the Dumb Vista users amongst you.\nIn this folder you will find information on how to add peer filtering to your azureus torrent client.\nBut my advice is.. go back to Windows XP!\n\n\n\n\nFIREFOX PLUGINS:\n\nNoscript\n----------\n\nThe NoScript Firefox extension provides extra protection for Firefox, Flock, Seamonkey and others mozilla-based browsers: \nthis free, open source add-on allows JavaScript, Java, Flash and other plugins to be executed only by trusted web sites of your choice \n(e.g. your online bank), and provides the most powerful Anti-XSS protection available in a browser.\n\nNoScript&amp;#039;s unique whitelist based pre-emptive script blocking approach prevents exploitation of security vulnerabilities \n(known and even not known yet!) with no loss of functionality..\n\n\nPhistank\n-----------\nPhishing is a fraudulent attempt, usually made through email, to steal your personal information. \nThe best way to protect yourself from phishing is to learn how to recognize a phish.\nPhishing emails usually appear to come from a well-known organization and ask for your personal information ? such as credit card number, \nsocial security number, account number or password. Often times phishing attempts appear to come from sites, \nservices and companies with which you do not even have an account.\nIn order for Internet criminals to successfully &quot;phish&quot; your personal information, they must get you to go from an email to a website. \nPhishing emails will almost always tell you to click a link that takes you to a site where your personal information is requested. \nLegitimate organizations would never request this information of you via email.\n\nAnd Phistank will protect you from the Nigerian niggers!\n\n\nAdblock Plus\n--------------\nOne of the best anti-advertisement plugins I have ever seen.\n\n\nDownloadthemall!\n-----------------\n\nThe first and only download manager/accelerator built inside Firefox!\nPeople who do allot of batch downloading (jpegs etc.. wink, wink) can use this plugin to handle their downloads.\nIt is fully configurable, but very compact.\n\n\n\ntor-proxy.net toolbar\n----------------------\nThis plugin places an extra url adress bar, which when used reroutes your connection through free anonymous proxy&amp;#039;s provided by TOR &amp; Proxy.net\nIf your not so familiar with proxy&amp;#039;s, this bar is your best choice.\nJust enter the url and choose between &amp;#039;by JAP/JonDos&amp;#039; or &amp;#039;by TOR&amp;#039; to reroute your internet connection through a proxy provided by either one \nthese two services.\n*though Jap/JonDos works best for me..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***************************\nJust drag these plugins individually onto your open firefox browser window and the installer will appear.\n\n\nSource for all plugins: https://addons.mozilla.org\n***************************\n\n\nUSE MOZILLA FIREFOX INSTEAD OF INTERNET EXPLORER, SINCE IT HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE MORE SECURE THEN I.E.:\n\nGo get it for free at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://download.mozilla.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://download.mozilla.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nKEYWORDS: , anti-virus, virus, antivirus, firewall, fire wall, addware, adware, \nad aware,adaware, trojan, trojans, virusses, security, securing, secure, phish, phishing, security pack, free, proxy, ads\n\n32-bit\n\n32 bit\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2757e7bdf934ed897c4d098ffbd552f6b3051450","amp;dn":"32-bit+Security+Pack+2008+%28DO+NOT+BECOME+A+SLAVE+OF+THE+BOTNET%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2757e7bdf934ed897c4d098ffbd552f6b3051450","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,87,231,189,249,52,237,137,124,77,9,143,251,213,82,246,179,5,20,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
