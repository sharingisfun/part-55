Unlike any other album they released, this one had a much calmer approach in the music style. While this sound turned off many older fans, some people felt that this is what the band was headed for ever since the release of Nothing Feels Good. While not their most popular album, it included the successful single &quot;Stop Playing Guitar&quot; as well as the song &quot;Say Goodbye Good,&quot; which played over the ending credits of the film All the Real Girls.\n\nThe album was released on CD by ANTI and double 10&quot; vinyl by Foreign Leisure Records. The vinyl release contains one bonus track, &quot;All Good Souls&quot;, and has a slightly altered track listing.\n\nThe turns the band had taken were some sharp ones. Lead singer Davey vonBohlen had recently undergone surgery for a fist-sized tumor in his head, which greatly affected his view on life, and thus his song writing.\n\nNot too long after the release of Wood/water, vonBohlen and drummer, Dan Didier decided that it was time to call it quits. The band broke up shortly after.\n\n[edit] Track listing\n\n   1. &quot;Size Of Your Life&quot; - 3:09\n   2. &quot;Stop Playing Guitar&quot; - 5:05\n   3. &quot;Suffer Never&quot; - 4:10\n   4. &quot;Become One Anything One Time&quot; - 4:19\n   5. &quot;Wake Up April&quot; - 5:07\n   6. &quot;Get On The Floor&quot; - 4:07\n   7. &quot;Half Year Sun&quot; - 5:40\n   8. &quot;My Life Is At Home&quot; - 4:16\n   9. &quot;Letters to the Far Reaches&quot; - 2:29\n  10. &quot;Bread and Coffee&quot; - 3:53\n  11. &quot;Say Goodbye Good&quot; - 6:37\n  12. &quot;Feed the Night&quot; - 3:04\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b56e9a75926125418e25058d6c06270697ac83d7","amp;dn":"The+Promise+Ring+-+Wood%2FWater","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b56e9a75926125418e25058d6c06270697ac83d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,110,154,117,146,97,37,65,142,37,5,141,108,6,39,6,151,172,131,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
