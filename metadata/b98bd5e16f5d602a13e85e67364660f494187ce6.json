As Time Goes By focuses on music largely from the 1930s and &amp;#039;40s and conjures that era&amp;#039;s aura of fine cigars, sateen gowns, and gentlemanly romance. The opening title track summons images of Bogie and Ingrid, and is one of the finest moments in the collection. The swanky versions of Nina Simone&amp;#039;s signature &quot;Love Me or Leave Me&quot; and &quot;I&amp;#039;m in the Mood for Love&quot; (which has a faint Martin Denny overtone) are perfectly suited to Ferry&amp;#039;s low-key vocals (he&amp;#039;s no real crooner, let&amp;#039;s face it). His talented band swings with fervor, especially on the upbeat tunes &quot;The Way You Look Tonight,&quot; &quot;Lover Come Back to Me,&quot; and &quot;Just One of Those Things.&quot; There are a number of intimate, romantic moments, but the highlight is Ferry&amp;#039;s take on &quot;Falling in Love Again,&quot; first made famous way back when with devastating sadness by Marlene Dietrich. Ferry&amp;#039;s version is almost as moving.\n\n\nBryan Ferry - As Time Goes By\n\n1. As Time Goes By \t\n2. The Way You Look Tonight \t\n3. Easy Living \t\n4.
