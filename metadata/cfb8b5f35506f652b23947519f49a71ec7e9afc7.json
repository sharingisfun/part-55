It seems to be his first upload and he&amp;#039;s mistakenly created the torrent using mininova as the tracker which is not a proper announce. I tried to advise him through the comments page of his torrent, but I&amp;#039;m not sure if he&amp;#039;s read it. I think we may be able to save his torrent though. I&amp;#039;ve grabbed the torrent and put episodes 113 and 114 into the folder and done a recheck and gotten 99% on each. This typically happens because the piece sizes are different with a megapack hash but you&amp;#039;ll still have the complete file if you download from me. If you want those 2 episodes( and I&amp;#039;ll be adding more as people complete those), or want to help seed other eps you have, go to Mininova and search for &quot;TOCH-Season1&quot; and download the torrent. Put it in your client, but before starting the download, select the files that you want to download or to seed and mark them &quot;normal&quot; priority and the ones you don&amp;#039;t want as &quot;do not download&quot;. Start the download (stop and do a recheck if you&amp;#039;ve added files, then start again) and wait until dht kicks in then add http://open.tracker.thepiratebay.se/announce and you should be able to connect to our brave uploader or me. I&amp;#039;m sorry I can&amp;#039;t create a megapack like that because of other torrent obligations. I&amp;#039;ve been hoping that someone would do it and finally it&amp;#039;s happened. but... well, I think we may be able to get this one to work if we all pitch in. Unless we connect with the uploader, there will be blank pieces between episodes, but this will not effect the individual video files. They will be complete and watchable. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfb8b5f35506f652b23947519f49a71ec7e9afc7","amp;dn":"12+OCLOCK+HIGH+216-217+%5Bretr%3Ftv%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfb8b5f35506f652b23947519f49a71ec7e9afc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,184,181,243,85,6,246,82,178,57,71,81,159,73,167,30,199,233,175,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
