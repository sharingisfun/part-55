But below that frozen mass, a fantastic environment of indescribable beauty teems with life. NATURE takes viewers into the world that is &quot;Under Antarctic Ice.&quot;\n\nThis beautiful film was shot in high definition format over a period of two years by renowned underwater photographer Norbert Wu, who has been exploring the waters beneath the Antarctic ice cap for some time.\n\nTo prepare for this adventurous exploration, Wu and two oceanographic researchers set up base at the famed frontier outpost of McMurdo Station, within sight of volcanic Mount Erebus. From there, with the help of a dive coordinator at McMurdo, they carefully searched for places where the ice was thin enough to dig access holes and where the environment below was suitable and reasonably safe for a descent. Throughout the film, Wu and his companions find ingenious ways to bring us a world that only a small fraction of humanity will ever witness firsthand. \n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n\nVideo Codec: Divx6\nVideo Bitrate: 3500\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.75:1\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio BitRate: 384kbps 48kHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRunTime Per Part: 53\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1400\nRipped by maga998\n\nwww mvgroup org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9479c6cc7717c4423c5f53c8b586c4b61084d361","amp;dn":"PBS+Under.the.Antarctic.Ice.720p.Divx6.Ac3.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9479c6cc7717c4423c5f53c8b586c4b61084d361","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,121,198,204,119,23,196,66,60,95,83,200,181,134,196,182,16,132,211,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
