It seems Chester was fully recovered for this show.\n- During the break between the two encores, the crowd started chanting for &amp;#039;Bleed It Out&amp;#039;. The band then came out and played the song, which was pretty cool.\n- It seems Brad cut his finger at the end of the show. A fan has said that they saw him go up to a camera at the end of the show and hold his finger really close to it. \n\nInfo taken from www.lplive.net - The Linkin Park Live Guide\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:583535be05652f97108b8b0595b72c78610dc6a7","amp;dn":"Linkin+Park+-+Live+In+Sacramento+%282008-03-10%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"583535be05652f97108b8b0595b72c78610dc6a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,53,53,190,5,101,47,151,16,139,139,5,149,183,44,120,97,13,198,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
