Jeremy Sisto stars as the ruler of the Roman Emperor, with a strong supporting cast in Richard Harris (as Lucius Sulla), Christopher Walken (as Marcus Cato), and Chris North (as Pompey). The story is filled with epic drama, telling the familiar tale of a leader fueled by power, who was loved and loathed in equal measures, and who ultimately fell at the hands of his greatest ally, Brutus. This faithful rendition of the tale is action-packed, and draws on all the experience of the cast and crew to portray some heady, historical times in ancient Rome.
