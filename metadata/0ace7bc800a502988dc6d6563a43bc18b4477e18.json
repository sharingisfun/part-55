Written by Wired.com editor Leander Kahney, The Cult of iPod is a comprehensive look at how Apple\\&amp;#039;s hit iPod is changing music, culture, and listening behavior. The Cult of iPod includes the exclusive back story of the iPod\\&amp;#039;s development; looks at the many ways iPod\\&amp;#039;s users pay homage to their devices; and investigates the quirkier aspects of iPod culture, such as iPod-jacking (strangers plugging into each other\\&amp;#039;s iPods to discover new music), as well as the growing legions of MP3Js (regular folks who use their iPods to become DJs). Four-color throughout. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ace7bc800a502988dc6d6563a43bc18b4477e18","amp;dn":"Cult+of+iPod+by+Leander+Kahney","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ace7bc800a502988dc6d6563a43bc18b4477e18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,206,123,200,0,165,2,152,141,198,214,86,58,67,188,24,180,71,126,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
