So far to no avail, but a recent breakthrough suggests they may one day succeed.\n\nHorizon joins the planet hunters who&amp;#039;ve discovered a new world called Gliese 581 c. It is the most Earth-like planet yet found around another star and may have habitats capable of supporting life. NASA too hopes to find fifty more Earth-like planets by the end of the decade, all of which dramatically increases the chance that alien life has begun elsewhere in the galaxy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fedc204e2f438886e89c45b2b5798c7aa80db1e2","amp;dn":"BBC.Horizon.AreWeAloneInTheUniverse.XviD.mp3.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fedc204e2f438886e89c45b2b5798c7aa80db1e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,220,32,78,47,67,136,134,232,156,69,178,181,121,140,122,168,13,177,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
