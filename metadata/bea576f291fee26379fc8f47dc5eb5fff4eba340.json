Some open only briefly and by the time one gets a tipoff, all the places have gone and registrations are closed again.\n\nThe Tracker Checker 2 installer is small at just under 130kb. Needing the .NET framework to run, it installs pain-free in seconds and with a click of the shortcut, itÃƒÂ¢??s ready to find those elusive no-invitation-required open signups on private trackers. It can sit in your system tray silently checking for open signups and alerting you when they become available.\n\nBy simply clicking on the site in the list you wish to signup to, followed by the globe icon, an instance of your web browser is launched and you are taken directly to the new account page and you are ready to signup.\n\nAlthough itÃƒÂ¢??ll take some time to exhaust the content available on the pre-configured trackers, itÃƒÂ¢??s inevitable that at some point youÃƒÂ¢??ll wish to add new sites for the software to check and fortunately, this\nis fairly straightforward. Clicking the ÃƒÂ¢??AddÃƒÂ¢?? icon brings up a box where one can enter various details.\n\nSimply enter the tracker name for reference, followed by the siteÃƒÂ¢??s signup\nURL (commonly http://www.sitename.com/signup.php or http://www.sitename.com/register.php) followed by a text search string. On certain sites where one signs up to a forum, ÃƒÂ¢??Desired UsernameÃƒÂ¢?? appears on the page when signups are open, so entering this into the ÃƒÂ¢??Find StringÃƒÂ¢?? box produces the desired results when the ÃƒÂ¢??PositiveÃƒÂ¢?? match button is clicked.\n\nIf for example the signup page currently says ÃƒÂ¢??signups are closedÃƒÂ¢??, by entering this same text into the ÃƒÂ¢??Find StringÃƒÂ¢?? section but selecting ÃƒÂ¢??NegativeÃƒÂ¢?? match, you will notified when this text does not appear (when signups are open).\n\n\n&gt;Enjoy The Program And Please Seed As Much As You Can&lt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bea576f291fee26379fc8f47dc5eb5fff4eba340","amp;dn":"Tracker+Checker+2.0.3+%28Check+Torrent+Sites+For+Open+Registration","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bea576f291fee26379fc8f47dc5eb5fff4eba340","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,165,118,242,145,254,226,99,121,252,143,71,220,94,181,255,244,235,163,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
