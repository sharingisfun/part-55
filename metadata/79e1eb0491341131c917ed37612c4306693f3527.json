It is already tagged for itunes so when you add it to itunes and your ipod it will automatically organize itself.\n\nIf you are wondering because this is posted before the movies release date it is a dvd rip quality is on par with my other posts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79e1eb0491341131c917ed37612c4306693f3527","amp;dn":"Mad+Money+%28for+ipod%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79e1eb0491341131c917ed37612c4306693f3527","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,225,235,4,145,52,17,49,201,23,237,55,97,44,67,6,105,63,53,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
