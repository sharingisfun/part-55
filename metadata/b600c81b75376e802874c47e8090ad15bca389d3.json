It was also one of the first -- arguably the very first -- concept album. Sinatra, Riddle, and producer Voyle Gilmore decided that the new album format should be a special event, featuring a number of songs arranged around a specific theme; in addition, the new format was capable of producing a more detailed sound, which gave Riddle more freedom in his arrangements and orchestrations. Songs for Young Lovers is a perfect example of this. Supported by a small orchestra, Sinatra and Riddle create an intimate, romantic atmosphere on the record, breathing new life into standards like &quot;My Funny Valentine,&quot; &quot;They Can't Take That Away from Me,&quot; &quot;I Get a Kick Out of You,&quot; and &quot;A Foggy Day.&quot; There is a breezy confidence to Sinatra's singing, and Riddle's arrangements are more complex than they initially appear","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b600c81b75376e802874c47e8090ad15bca389d3","amp;dn":"Frank+Sinatra+-+Songs+For+Young+Lovers+%5BFlac%5D%5BTNT%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b600c81b75376e802874c47e8090ad15bca389d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,0,200,27,117,55,110,128,40,116,196,126,128,144,173,21,188,163,137,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
