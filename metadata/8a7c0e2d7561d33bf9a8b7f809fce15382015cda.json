When a Predator scout ship crash-lands in the hills outside the town, Alien facehuggers are released in the crash, and an even more evil creature - a hybrid Alien/Predator - is also released. A man &amp; his son hunting in the forests near the crash site soon become the first victims of the facehuggers, and when a Predator receives data about the crash on his home planet, he comes to Earth. One at a time, the inhabitants of the town become targets of the Aliens and the Predator, including the local sheriff, a young female soldier recently returned from Iraq, and several teens. Though the National Guard is called in, they are unable to stop the deadly creatures, and a plan is set in motion to destroy the town with a nuclear device...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a7c0e2d7561d33bf9a8b7f809fce15382015cda","amp;dn":"AVPR%3A+Aliens+vs+Predator+-+Requiem+%282007%29+PAL+DVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a7c0e2d7561d33bf9a8b7f809fce15382015cda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,124,14,45,117,97,211,59,249,168,183,248,9,252,225,83,130,1,92,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
