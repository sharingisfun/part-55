The adventure, which takes place in 3D using pre-rendered backgrounds, drags you through spooky crash sites, abandoned buildings, experiments gone wrong and more -- all the while battling undead monstrosities, solving puzzles and, most of all, trying to stay alive. Lots of weapons and other gadgetry allow for some truly disgusting mayhem. It&amp;#039;s an incredibly frightening game that delivers a light back-story and lots of slasher movie, jump-out-and-go-boo scares.\n\n\nDOWNLOAD POPSTATION IF WANTED CONVERTED TO PSP","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ea89ba2f728509ee254eeadf82bb8a0a6726d96","amp;dn":"RESIDENT+EVIL+2+%7B2+CDS%7D+%5B%5BPLAYSTATION+ONE%5D%5D+%28DRAGON%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ea89ba2f728509ee254eeadf82bb8a0a6726d96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,168,155,162,247,40,80,158,226,84,238,173,248,43,184,160,166,114,109,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
