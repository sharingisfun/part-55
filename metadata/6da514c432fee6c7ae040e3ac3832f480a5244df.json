The movie is exactly the length of a DV Tape and a sub-plot is established by showing bits and pieces of video previously recorded on the tape that is being recorded over. The movie starts as a monster of unknown origin destroys a building. As they go to investigate, parts of the building and the head of the Statue of Liberty come raining down. The movie follows their adventure trying to escape and save a friend, a love interest of the main character.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6da514c432fee6c7ae040e3ac3832f480a5244df","amp;dn":"Cloverfield","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6da514c432fee6c7ae040e3ac3832f480a5244df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,165,20,196,50,254,230,199,174,4,14,58,195,131,47,72,10,82,68,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
