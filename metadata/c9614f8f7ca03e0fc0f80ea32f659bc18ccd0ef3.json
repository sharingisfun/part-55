For unknown reasons, \nthey christened themselves Toe Fat and managed to get signed to Parlophone and then to Regal Zonophone in England, \nwith their albums appearing in America on the Rare Earth label. Their mix of blues and progressive rock wasn&amp;#039;t the \nmost commercial of sounds in any case, and the grotesque cover art on the group&amp;#039;s two LPs seemed to repel potential\npurchasers. By 1970, Hensley had left to hook up with David Byron and Mick Box in what would become Uriah Heep, \nand Kerslake followed his lead out of Toe Fat. Brian Glascock came in on drums and Alan Kendall joined on guitar \nfor one U.S. tour, but the group finally split up in 1972. Kerslake subsequently re-teamed with Hensley and joined \nUriah Heep, while John Glascock later joined Jethro Tull and Alan Kendall joined the Bee Gees, initially as a \nsession guitarist and later as a permanent bandmember, where he remained until the early &amp;#039;80s. Toe Fat&amp;#039;s two LPs \nwere reissued on a single CD in the mid-&amp;#039;90s by the Beat Goes On label. ~ Bruce Eder, All Music Guide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9614f8f7ca03e0fc0f80ea32f659bc18ccd0ef3","amp;dn":"Toe+Fat1%262+%28Ken+Hensley+Uriah+Heep%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9614f8f7ca03e0fc0f80ea32f659bc18ccd0ef3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,97,79,143,124,160,62,15,192,248,14,163,47,101,155,193,140,205,14,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
