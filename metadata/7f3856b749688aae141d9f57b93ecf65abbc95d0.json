No, Sharon chose the actors for their acting skills, not for their breasts, she says (well, those skills are NOT unparalleled). The only two girls in the film that have breasts we don&amp;#039;t get to see much of, breast-wise (it&amp;#039;s not The L-Word 5). Regard it as a tribute to small-breasted women, says Sharon. Small breast are big now, she jokes. And she adds, as a comment alluding to some feminist branches, mainly in the U.S., where women increase their busts because big breasts are thought woman-ish, and therefore feminist: &amp;#039;Never ever let anyone tell you lesbians are feminists; they are not, they are lesbians&amp;#039;. \n\nNo steadicam. Particularly low-budget music soundtrack, not so much for the music itself as for how it is mixed with the foley+dialogue soundtrack. Blood, gore and &amp;#039;suspense&amp;#039;. And a bunch of unpleasant men you decidedly want to fight off.\n\nSome people think this is a really bad movie.\nSome think it&amp;#039;s so bad it&amp;#039;s actually quite good.\nSome people don&amp;#039;t care, they just like it; I&amp;#039;m not sure why, though. Perhaps for the fact that it&amp;#039;s about girls who know how love is made. Or because there are one or two one-liners you would like to deliver yourself, once in a while.\n\nSo be warned. Only download it if you &amp;#039;dare&amp;#039; to.\n\nVideo poster: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/HaJnJAaBb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/HaJnJAaBb&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f3856b749688aae141d9f57b93ecf65abbc95d0","amp;dn":"%28Lesbian+Horror%29+Make+a+Wish+%28DivX%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f3856b749688aae141d9f57b93ecf65abbc95d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,56,86,183,73,104,138,174,20,29,159,87,185,62,207,101,171,188,149,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
