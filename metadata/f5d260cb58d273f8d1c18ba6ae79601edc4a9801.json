The hard drives     \n have moving mechanical parts, making them slow to   \n access a particular spot on the magnetic storage    \n media. While sustained transfer rates of modern     \n hard disks are high, the need to seek for a         \n position on the surface of the disk makes random    \n access extremely slow. If your system has a lot of  \n read-write operations on a limited set of files,    \n moving the frequently accessed data off the actual  \n hard disk into computer&amp;#039;s memory can speed up       \n operation and reduce access times dramatically.     \n                                                     \n A RAM disk is stored in the computer&amp;#039;s memory. It   \n has no moving parts and does not need to seek for   \n information.                                        \n Safe Operation                                      \n                                                     \n RAM disks are volatile by their nature. The data is \n stored in the computer&amp;#039;s memory, making it          \n disappear the very moment you reboot or switch off  \n your PC. Now with DiskBoost!                        \n                                                     \n If you are using a virtual disk to store sensitive  \n data, DiskBoost can maintain a shadow copy of the   \n virtual disk on your hard drive, periodically       \n saving the complete contents of your RAM disk into  \n a real file. If you a running a server, DiskBoost   \n can create a shadow copy of the entire partition on \n the hard drive!                                     \n                                                     \n Thanks to built-in backup capability and automatic  \n data synchronization, DiskBoost RAM drives are as   \n safe to use as the hard disks.                      \n Complete Data Security                              \n                                                     \n DiskBoost safeguards your sensitive data with       \n special measures. Everything you store on a         \n DiskBoost drive is encrypted automatically and      \n transparently on-the-fly. Disk images stored on     \n your hard drive are also securely encrypted, making \n their contents completely useless to a malicious    \n person without knowing a proper password. You can   \n even prohibit mounting the protected disks by       \n requiring a password-to-mount!                      \n Volatile Data                                       \n                                                     \n What if there is something on your system that you  \n specifically do not want to keep for security       \n reasons? Cached passwords, tracking cookies,        \n Internet cache and browsing history are the most    \n obvious examples. Simply store the volatile data on \n a DiskBoost RAM disk and mark the disk as           \n Temporary, and all its content will be wiped off    \n completely and unrecoverable when you reboot your   \n PC or un-mount the virtual disk!                    \n Travel Light. Work Fast.                            \n                                                     \n You can take a USB flash drive with you, but how    \n secure is information you keep there? How fast does \n it read and write data? DiskBoost makes traveling   \n light not only possible, but quick and secure.      \n Simply store an image of a DiskBoost virtual drive  \n on a USB flash card, and you&amp;#039;ll automatically       \n receive the same speed, security and convenience of \n DiskBoost RAM drives!                               \n Transparent On-The-Fly Operation                    \n                                                     \n The RAM drive will appear to you as any other disk  \n would. You&amp;#039;ll see no difference between DiskBoost   \n virtual disks, hard disks or USB flash disks except \n in performance. DiskBoost drives will be faster     \n than any other drive on your system!                \n                                                     \n You don&amp;#039;t need to run anything to work with the     \n virtual disks. Just read and write files and        \n folders as you would on any other disk, and         \n DiskBoost will handle the mechanics on-the-fly and  \n completely transparently.                           \n Convenient Operation                                \n                                                     \n DiskBoost virtual drives are not just faster and    \n more secure than hard disks, but at least as        \n convenient. DiskBoost will be mounted quickly and   \n automatically when your computer loads, giving you  \n immediate access to the blazingly fast disks.       \n Compare DiskBoost&amp;#039;s lightning speed with your hard  \n drive in your everyday work, and there will be no   \n going back for you!                                 \n Feature List                                        \n                                                     \n * Speeds up disk speed and reduces random access    \n time                                                \n * Blazingly fast file operations                    \n * Virtual disks mount automatically when the system \n boots                                               \n * Create temporary RAM drives or permanent images   \n * Automatic hard drive synchronization and backup   \n capabilities protect your data against loss         \n * Guaranteed wipe of sensitive data                 \n * Transparent operation: files and folders are read \n and written on-the-fly                              \n * Complete security: data is encrypted on-the-fly   \n * Protect disk images with a password               \n * Strong encryption ensures complete security       \n * Travel light with DiskBoost images on a USB flash \n                                                     ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5d260cb58d273f8d1c18ba6ae79601edc4a9801","amp;dn":"DiskBoost.v2.0.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5d260cb58d273f8d1c18ba6ae79601edc4a9801","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,210,96,203,88,210,115,248,209,193,139,166,174,121,96,30,220,74,152,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
