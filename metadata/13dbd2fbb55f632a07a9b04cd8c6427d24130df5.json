It was released on December 5, 2006 (December 2 in Australia and United Kingdom). The new 2-disc DVD set features a film on the band over 80 minutes long made by band member Shawn &quot;Clown&quot; Crahan (#6) on Disc 1. The majority of this film is shot on hand held cameras. Disc 2 contains all of the music videos from their album Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses), including the unreleased &quot;Vermilion Pt. 2&quot; video as well as interviews with most of the band members unmasked and other live footage. Lead guitarist Mick Thomson (#7) has stated that this DVD focuses more on the band&amp;#039;s days of touring in support of their new album behind the stage and on the road, not just a live show. He said &quot;You will see more of what our days are like,&quot; and also that the video &quot;will be like nothing ever before and more funny shit than the last DVD.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13dbd2fbb55f632a07a9b04cd8c6427d24130df5","amp;dn":"Voliminal.Inside.The.Nine.Disc.Two.DVDRip-ThePiraten","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13dbd2fbb55f632a07a9b04cd8c6427d24130df5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,219,210,251,181,95,99,42,7,169,176,76,216,198,66,125,36,19,13,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
