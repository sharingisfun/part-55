It threatens to demolish the foundations of 20th century physics. Its authors are two of the world&amp;#039;s leading cosmologists. If they&amp;#039;re right, Einstein was wrong. It all began when Andy Albrecht and Joao Magueijo met at a conference in America in 1996.\n\nThis program began from Newtonian view of the universe then takes you through the General Relativity and the Flatness problem. This leads to the Horizon problem and its solution, the Inflation theory. However modern astronomy doesn&amp;#039;t stop here, the Inflation theory has its flaw too, and what happened before the big bang? This can all be answered by changing one thing, the one thing no body dare to question until now.\n\n  \n  \n\n\nTechnical Specs\n\nVideo Codec: DivX 5.1.1\nVideo Bitrate: 1702 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 688 x 448\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.536:1\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio BitRate: 256 kbps CBR\nAudio Channels: 2\nRunTime Per Part: 50 min\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 699 MB\nRipped by iCy-fLaME\n\n\nSpecial note about the audio:\n\nAlthough coming from a DVD source, this is technically a VHS rip, it was recorded when it aired back in year 2000, using a DVD recorder from the TV-out of a VHS recorder. \n\nThere is a slight artificial echo effect in the sound track if listen carefully using a pair of head phone.\n\nAll attempts to correct for this artifact failed, hence the original AC3 is used in this rip.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:810b27f50dadb2f6f970586398df0a1148b799e9","amp;dn":"Equinox+Einsteins+Biggest+Blunder+DivX511+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"810b27f50dadb2f6f970586398df0a1148b799e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,11,39,245,13,173,178,246,249,112,88,99,152,223,10,17,72,183,153,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
