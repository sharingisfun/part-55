Where to start? As I inserted the baby into my stereo I almost passed out. This is what should be out more! Supershit 666 consists of guitarist Dregen (Backyard Babies), drummer Nick Royale (the Hellacopters), guitarist Ginger (the Wildhearts) and bassist Tomas Skogsberg. The malicious grunting of Wire Out, the opening track, is phenomenal. The sounds are pretty much as juicy as on the first Hellacopters-album &quot;Supershitty To The Max!&quot;. Well, it`s actually pretty obvious since the producer is the same, Tomas Skogsberg, who also plays bass on this release. There isn`t a bad song on this, they all keep charging up energy and aggression. Unfortunately this mini-album is also short. But hey, go get the full-length-album! A song called Star War Jr appears on this records. In the inlays Ginger writes that it was originally going to be a b-side of a new Hellacopters-single, but they caught it first. Curiosly the same song is on the Backyard Babies-album &quot;Making Enemies Is Good&quot;, with the name Star War. This version just sounds a lot more brutal and primitive, less polished. The last track of this release is a coversong, Crank It Up! by The Rods and they really do some justice with it. If you haven`t bought your copy yet, DO IT NOW!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2646ce428b3ca280cc67c510dcabd2fbe170e9dd","amp;dn":"Super%24hit666+EP+1999+%5BM4A+Apple+Lossless%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2646ce428b3ca280cc67c510dcabd2fbe170e9dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,70,206,66,139,60,162,128,204,103,197,16,220,171,210,251,225,112,233,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
