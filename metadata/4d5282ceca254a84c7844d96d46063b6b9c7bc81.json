He&amp;#039;s a very talented, yet mysterious computer programmer. Because of his incredible abilities, he&amp;#039;s contacted by several individuals (curiously, all of them are very similar persons named Akizuki Kaoru) to do all sorts of strange computer-related hacking/security jobs. He&amp;#039;s a very quiet guy who lives alone in a small apartment near his niece&amp;#039;s house.\n\n########## DVD Image Credits: ##########\n\n- Encoding by: TEAM [OtakuDVD]\n- DVD Authoring by: TEAM [OtakuDVD]\n- Packed by: TEAM [OtakuDVD]\n\n########## Source Credits: ###########\n\n- Source Video: Xvid Video/MP3 audio in .avi container format.\n- Source Released by: #Anime-Influx\n- Translation by: Fansub Group #Anime-Influx\n\n################################################################################\n###############\t\tFILES IN THIS RELEASE\t\t########################\n################################################################################\n\n- FILE NAME: [OtakuDVD]_Battle_Programmer_Shirase.iso\n- FILE SIZE: 3.56GB\n- FILE TYPE: DVD Image\n- HOW TO USE: Burn to blank DVD-R at _no more_ than 3x speed with your favorite burning program.  We recommend (and test burn these .iso files) using Nero 8.\n\n################################################################################\n###############\t\tFAQ and Common Problems\t\t########################\n################################################################################\n\n- Q: Why are the subtitles cut off by the screen edges in certain parts of the video?\n\n- A: You are probably watching the DVD on an older/smaller TV-set.  Although we adjust the video to push the subtitles to inside of the &quot;TV safe&quot; area, some older TV sets may still cut the extreme edges of them off at certain places during playback.  So far we&amp;#039;ve yet to find a set that does this to the extent that it makes our releases un-watchable.\n\nThat said we&amp;#039;re still testing our methods and have a limited number of TVs to test them on.  We&amp;#039;ll probably find a method that is &quot;just right&quot; for older sets as we release more files\n\n- Q: Why are there ugly black bars around the video?\n\n- A: Again this is a side effect of making the subtitles display inside of the &quot;TV Safe&quot; area.  Most people that experience this problem are watching our releases on HDTVs.  \n\nCouple of solutions:\n\n1) Turn off &quot;smart stretching&quot; if your HDTV supports that option.\n2) Watch our releases in their native 4:3 resolution.\n3) If the release is in &quot;letterbox&quot; format try the &quot;wide screen&quot; resolution on your HDTV.  We are using it with good results.\n4) Ignore them. ;)\n\n- Q: Why does the video &quot;skip&quot; in certain places?\n\n- A: You probably burned the .iso file at a speed that was too fast for your DVD player to handle.  We recommend burning at a speed no faster than 3x!  Use 1x if your software/burning supports it! ;)\n\nAnother problem could be the blank media you&amp;#039;re using.  Make sure to burn using only high quality DVD-Rs.\n\nWe test these files on a Playstation 2 which is _very_ iffy about playing burned DVDs correctly and have no issues with them.\n\n- Q: Why does the audio sound _awful_?\n\n- A: Some DVD players allow you to amplify the audio.  Make sure you turn that setting off or choose a lower setting.  For example on the Playstation 2 there exists three options: Disabled, +1, and +2.  +2 sounds &quot;awful&quot; while setting amplification to +1 or disabled sounds just fine. \n\n- Q: How can we contact you?/Where is your IRC channel?/Where is your website?\n\n- A: Contact information/IRC channel/website will be available soon.  For now if you want to contact us leave comments on the torrent site where you found this release.\n\n- Q: When is the next release coming out?\n\n- A: When it is ready!\n\n- Q: Don&amp;#039;t fansub groups have a problem with people converting their releases to DVD format?\n\n- A: I&amp;#039;m sure some of them do...but [OtakuDVD] likes to think we&amp;#039;re not going against the &quot;ethics&quot; of fansubbing.\n\nWe _do not_ remove the fansub groups credits from the files and we properly credit them in our .nfo files.  We _don&amp;#039;t_ ask for permission from the group(s) but then again we don&amp;#039;t think we should have to.\n\nAt any rate if they&amp;#039;re mad at us for it it&amp;#039;s their problem... They should know that once something is in the wild it&amp;#039;s bound to be modified and re-released at some point anyway.\n\n################################################################################\n####################\t\tWho is [OtakuDVD]?\t\t################\n################################################################################\n\nWe are a group dedicated to bringing Japanese animation to the West in a format that anyone will be able to watch without mucking around with installing codec packs or other &quot;complicated&quot; software and hardware solutions.\n\nWe target &quot;normal people&quot; in other words and hope to expose more people to unedited anime in its native language.   \n\nWe _support_ the growing Anime industry in the West and encourage you to buy the official DVDs when they become available in your region.\n\nPlease give away our releases to others who are unable to download/burn them for themselves.
