The undecoded MP3 files were cut with mp3DirectCut, optimized with mp3packer (removing a buffer underrun of frame &quot;0&quot;) and MP3val (correcting the MP3-file length reported by the MP3 header for proper seeking). Foobar2k was used to add ID3-tags, to avoid clipping by scaling the Global Gain to 89dB and to add ReplayGain tags. Final quality (TMB HQ): 192kbps 44.1kHz VBR stereo MP3. All MP3-players will play the files as usual. After all the optimizations, a third (for normal stereo mp3-players invisible) channel with 32-48kbps 5.1 surround extension has been added with the MP3SX converter. This results in a final bitrate for both sets of 224-240kbps. Check the Fraunhofer explanations HERE. A software player for the MP3SX / MP3 Surround content can be found at all4mp3.com.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:440b99d7e39d0cdf8ffc317f12c9a707c49554b6","amp;dn":"Matt+Darey+-+Nocturnal+Radio+Show+%23134+-+%282008-03-01%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"440b99d7e39d0cdf8ffc317f12c9a707c49554b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,11,153,215,227,157,12,223,143,252,49,127,18,201,167,7,196,149,84,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
