For 10 years he led the battle within organized medicine in California to address the AIDS epidemic as a medical issue rather than a civil rights issue. As a result of his experiences trying to implement an effective medical approach to the HIV epidemic, he wrote the book, &quot;AIDS:The Unnecessary Epidemic&quot;, the widely circulated pamphlet, &quot;To Deceive a Nation&quot;, and more recently, &quot;A Nation Deceived and Betrayed.&quot; Supported by physicians across our nation, his public health approach to the HIV epidemic was eventually accepted by the California Medical Association. Unfortunately, powerful forces continue to oppose the dictates of doctors. Dr Monteith currently spends five hours daily on talk radio, writes extensively, and lectures on geopolitics. He has spent 30 years researching the causes for America&amp;#039;s spiritual and moral decline.\n\nDr. Stans guest is Joel Skousen.\n\nJoel Skousen is a political scientist, by training, specializing in the philosophy of law and Constitutional theory, and is also a designer of high security residences and retreats.
