Ruiz is accused of\nkilling a beautiful businesswoman and guru of a high\ntech software empire catering to the military. One key\nto the case that&amp;#039;s especially damning for Madriani&amp;#039;s\nclient: the murder weapon is one used only in special\noperations where the &quot;double tap&quot; has become the\nsignature of the most skilled assassins.\n\nRuiz is sitting on a story he says he&amp;#039;s not at liberty to\ntell - a seven-year-gap on his military resume for which\nMadriani can find no details. And more troubling,\nMadriani discovers that the victim and her company\nwere involved in a controversial government computer\nprogram designed to combat terrorists. Madriani finds\nhimself in a deadly legal quagmire - with a client who\nrefuses to help and prosecutors who stonewall every\nquestion about the victim&amp;#039;s shadowy business and his\nclient&amp;#039;s past. Finding justice and the unvarnished truth\nhas never been so elusive - or so dangerous.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c6f016d6e8654f494c5c701ad8c63f5081d5d2c","amp;dn":"Steve+Martini+-+Double+Tap+%282005%29+48k+.MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c6f016d6e8654f494c5c701ad8c63f5081d5d2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,111,1,109,110,134,84,244,148,197,199,1,173,140,99,245,8,29,93,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
