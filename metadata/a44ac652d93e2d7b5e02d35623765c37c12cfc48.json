With help from\npowerhouse band, Hazzard, singer/songwriter Dana Hazzard pens the final chapter\nof Yellow House history with unsurpassed maturity, insight, and that old-school\ncountry groove. A familiar face from the Stillwater-based abode that was once\nhome to Red Dirt music demi-gods Cody Canada, Jason Boland, and Stoney LaRue,\nthis one-time Straggler's recent effort with bandmates Mark LeMond (acoustic\nguitar), Christian Dean (lead &amp; rhythm guitar), Matt Murphy (bass), and Jamie\nDotson (drums) makes a welcome u-turn to country music's roots with\nthought-provoking lyrics, masterful melodies, and solid-gold harmony. Look for\nthis northeastern Oklahoma band's debut, Choices, in 2008.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a44ac652d93e2d7b5e02d35623765c37c12cfc48","amp;dn":"Hazzard+-+Choices+%5B2008%2FVBR193%5D-404","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a44ac652d93e2d7b5e02d35623765c37c12cfc48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,74,198,82,217,62,45,123,94,2,211,86,35,118,92,55,193,44,252,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
