This Norwegian band made no efforts to facilitate the listening experience: this album bathes in misery, depression and desperation. The three songs clock at +10 minutes featuring monolithic, extreme doom-metal, with only some serene acoustic parts and some occasional guitar solo&amp;#039;s that help a bit to endure the almost unbearable pain.\n\nThe band didn&amp;#039;t use on this album the monotonous, cheerless female vocals they used in their second album &amp;#039;Tragedies&amp;#039;, but the low, depressive male vocals won&amp;#039;t make you feel better neither.\n\nIn short: if you like extreme, monolithic funeral doom or if you are addicted to heaviness in genenal and you are one of the happy few that came across this album: don&amp;#039;t hesitate to get it!\n\nTragedies (1995, Arctic Serenades)\nYou have depressive bands, and you have Funeral. If you manage to listen to a whole album from this band resisting the urge to switch over to something more cheerful or alive, then you must be a true doomfreak!\n\nThis time, the band relies vocaly mostly on the monotonous, mourning voice from Toril Snyen, implemented by the deep grunts that were also featured in their extremely depressive debut album &amp;#039;Tristesse&amp;#039;. The production is not so obscure this time and it fits better with the more melodic, symphonic approach that the band chose for this album. The tempo is exclusively slow, making Funeral together with Skepticism, Thergothon and Esoteric one of the slowest and most depressive bands around.\n\nThe lyrics unveil a similar tendency to emphasize everything about this life that is negative, ugly and dissonant: &quot;Enlight the reek in which you dwell/you&amp;#039;re the weak, your soul has fell&quot;. The constantly mourning vocals from Toril remind of those from Veera Muhli in Unholy&amp;#039;s masterpiece &amp;#039;Gracefallen&amp;#039;, but they are even more monotonous and have a definate love it or hate it aspect in them.\n\nListening to this album is not easy, but it&amp;#039;s definately an unique experience of purification for those lost in the realms of depressive music!\n(Doom-Metal.com)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                          PLEASE SEED AFTER DOWNLOADING!!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc43ea490240e841b7b197678092ab47473a19e6","amp;dn":"Funeral+-+Tragedies+%7C+Tristesse+%282-CD+reissue%29+%5BFLAC%5D+%5B2006%5D+%5BFu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc43ea490240e841b7b197678092ab47473a19e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,67,234,73,2,64,232,65,183,177,151,103,128,146,171,71,71,58,25,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
