Gell-Mann was a contemporary of Richard Feynman (they shared the same secretary at CalTech) and coined the &amp;#039;Quark&amp;#039; model of elementary particles which he called &amp;#039;the 8-fold way&amp;#039; - both names reflect his other interests (Quark was a word that originated from James Joyce and the 8-fold way was from Buddhism; Gell-Mann wanted to study archeology before he opted for physics). His second wife says he is also known to practice bush-man clicks when taking a shower. \n\nIn his later years Gell-Mann has shifted from exploring fundamental particles to exploring the relationship between the simple and the complex (popularly known as &amp;#039;Complexity&amp;#039; theory) and developing a multi-disciplinary research centre for the purpose - The Santa Fe Institute (which the latter part of the film explores). \n\nName.........: Simply Complex - Murray Gell-Mann.avi\nFilesize.....: 449 MB (or 460,419 KB or 471,469,504 bytes)\nRuntime......: 00:48:14 (72,349 fr)\nVideo Codec..: DivX 5.0\nVideo Bitrate: 1183 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID&amp;#039;d as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 112 kb/s (56/ch, stereo) CBR \nFrame Size...: 336x192 (1.75:1) [=7:4]\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gell-Mann\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity_theory\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_Institute","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf7497ef49d3537611deab756b43d371003ca53a","amp;dn":"Equinox+Simply+Complex%2C+Murray+Gell-Mann","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf7497ef49d3537611deab756b43d371003ca53a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,116,151,239,73,211,83,118,17,222,171,117,107,67,211,113,0,60,165,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
