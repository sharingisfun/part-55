Alison&amp;#039;s reading of &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; may presage her beautiful &quot;Voice&quot; CD released in the UK last year. &quot;Only You&quot; and &quot;Love Resurrection&quot; may sounded dated to my teenager, but they both pulse with great energy and sound as great to me as they did when they pumped out on the dancefloor in the 80s. Previously unreleased in the US before this 1995 set, &quot;That Ole Devil Called Love&quot; was a song Billie Holiday nailed. Alison plays with the melody and shows a great affinity for this era of song. &quot;Weak In the Presence of Beauty&quot; is also a classic track with Alison&amp;#039;s fully committed vocals and great percussion. Tackling a tune that was a major hit for Elvis Presley and has been recorded by Nat King Cole, Bobby Darin, Peggy Lee &amp; Dinah Washington and then making it sound fresh is a major feat that Moyet accomplishes on her sterling version of &quot;Love Letters.&quot; &quot;This House&quot; is a somber dramatic track that Moyet builds into a tragedy of a broken love affair. &quot;Whispering Your Name&quot; is a delightful synth track from the underrated &quot;Essex&quot; CD. &quot;Singles&quot; is a blockbuster set that love resurrects some excellent performances from one of our best singers.
