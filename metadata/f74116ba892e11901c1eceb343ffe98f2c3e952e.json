Bear in mind that both these last solutions doesn&amp;#039;t allow the update of the program, the license allows it, until it doesn&amp;#039;t get banned from PC Tools... ;o) There is a first version of the program made portable with the batch file that launchs the program compiled with QBFC to avoid showing the relative DOS window, but that some AVs see sometimes as a virus. If your AV is one of them, or if you don&amp;#039;t trust too much to it, use the second one that runs directly the batch file. You will have the sloppy DOS window in the background but less complaints from antiviruses...\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f74116ba892e11901c1eceb343ffe98f2c3e952e","amp;dn":"Registry+Mechanic+7.0.0.1010+Portable%2B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f74116ba892e11901c1eceb343ffe98f2c3e952e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,65,22,186,137,46,17,144,28,30,206,179,67,255,233,143,44,62,149,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
