Showcasing the band at the very start of their \n\nÃƒÂ¢??classicÃƒÂ¢?? period, recorded several days before the landmark ÃƒÂ¢??Number of the BeastÃƒÂ¢?? album was released, this excellent \n\nconcert features almost the entire album amidst the best songs from the first two albums, all given a new perspective \n\nwith DickinsonÃƒÂ¢??s operatic vocals. He hasnÃƒÂ¢??t quite established the familiar air siren wail just yet, but thatÃƒÂ¢??s what makes this \n\nearly material all the more interesting, especially when compared to 1985ÃƒÂ¢??s definitive ÃƒÂ¢??Live After Death.ÃƒÂ¢?? This remains the \n\nfinal recording to feature drummer Clive Burr. The concert was also recorded on film under the same title, and can now \n\nbe found on ÃƒÂ¢??The History of Iron Maiden part 1: The Early DaysÃƒÂ¢?? DVD, which is also great.\nThe bandÃƒÂ¢??s early sound is captured perfectly here, as are the hints of the epic heavy metal monster Iron Maiden would \n\nbecome, with the lengthy classic ÃƒÂ¢??Hallowed Be Thy NameÃƒÂ¢?? setting the template for pretty much every album-closing track \n\nforever afterward. Everything is played precisely, but with enough cute errors to authenticate the performance; itÃƒÂ¢??s just a \n\nshame that the set-list here is almost exactly the same as that on the BBC Archives. Highlights include the cool opener \n\nÃƒÂ¢??Murders in the Rue Morgue,ÃƒÂ¢?? the ever-reliable ÃƒÂ¢??Phantom of the OperaÃƒÂ¢?? and the entire performance of the ÃƒÂ¢??Number of the \n\nBeastÃƒÂ¢?? material, wisely omitting the two weakest songs and even performing the B-side ÃƒÂ¢??Total Eclipse,ÃƒÂ¢?? which was later \n\nadded to re-releases of the album anyway.\nIron Maiden&amp;#039;s 1982 &amp;#039;Beast On The Road&amp;#039; tour has taken on a mythical quality among Metal fans as the tour and the album \n\nwhich really put Maiden at the forefront of Rock and Metal worldwide. The historical show from the Hammersmith Odeon \n\nhas been specially mixed and co-produced for the casket by Steve Harris and the band&amp;#039;s long serving sound engineer Doug \n\nHall. This double CD clearly illustrates how remarkable and ground breaking the tour was in support of the all time classic \n\nalbum, &amp;#039;The Number Of The Beast&amp;#039;. The accompanying inlay booklet is a complete recreation of the &amp;#039;Beast On The Road&amp;#039; \n\ntour programme and lists all the world tour dates and includes notes from the band written at that time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3bafd0316ca7011d9a23dc3666f805e2b77b741","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+Beast+Over+Hammersmith+CD1+%282002%29+%28Eddie%5C%27s+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3bafd0316ca7011d9a23dc3666f805e2b77b741","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,186,253,3,22,202,112,17,217,162,61,195,102,111,128,94,43,119,183,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
