I often see courses claiming that you can &quot;Learn To Make Video Games (No Programming Needed!)&quot; But unfortunately if you want to make anything more advanced than flappy bird you'll need a programming language under your belt. Learning programming is fundamental to any career in the software industry, games or otherwise, and Python is a great starting point.\r\n\r\nThis course is aimed at programmers looking to learn the basics of Python programming and assumes no prior knowledge. Python is an incredibly easy language to pick up on, it is written in straightforward English and is colour coded for maximum usability. Despite that it is powerful! Fully fledged programs are built running it. Companies using it to run their technologies include Google, Yahoo, CERN and NASA!\r\n\r\nI try to communicate with my students as much as possible! If you have a question I'm always available to ask! And I'll try my best to solve your problem; programming or otherwise.\r\n\r\nI believe in quality over quantity, I try to keep my lectures short and concise so you can take it all in, and easily refer back to videos in the future. All lectures are delivered in crisp 1080p, and each section comes with written material to recap what you've learned. This truly is one of the best ways to learn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a08ab54b8f8e694619ff76932538588186946adb","amp;dn":"UDEMY+A+ROOKIES+GUIDE+TO+PYTHON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a08ab54b8f8e694619ff76932538588186946adb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,138,181,75,143,142,105,70,25,255,118,147,37,56,88,129,134,148,106,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
