The first of a trilogy that didn't end up nearly as well as it started. (disclosure, I didn't see the final cut of the the third film, just a preview). It really showed the promise of starting a fresh new genre.\n\nPlenty of extras, and trailers from the trilogy.\n\n\nIf you'd like to buy the dvd, here is a link: http://www.simnet.is/hrafng/DVD%20Hrafninn/instructionsHowTobuyDVD.htm\n\nthey say that they will release the rest of the trilogy, but it doesn't seem to have happened over the years.  Post them if you get them. They'd be well appreciated.\n\nThanks to the original uploader!\n\nThis is an uncompressed PAL set of VIDEO_TS files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93eef8fb6305a3b081740957c6486faa1860867c","amp;dn":"Hrafn+Gunnlaugsson+-+When+the+Raven+Flies+-+1984","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93eef8fb6305a3b081740957c6486faa1860867c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,238,248,251,99,5,163,176,129,116,9,87,198,72,111,170,24,96,134,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
