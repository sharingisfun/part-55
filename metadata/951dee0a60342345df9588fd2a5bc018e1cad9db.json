Austin University in Nacogdoches, TX. She was an only child, whose parents lived in Houston, Texas. To her knowledge, she was not adopted, however, there is speculation that her parents were not her biological ones.\n\nMaddison&amp;#039;s interests included music, which was often used as background music in her videos, and thriller movies with a theme of murder and violence. She had a crush on a boy in a local band. She wore very stylish clothes and did not drink or do drugs.\n\nOn April 11th, 2007, she received a mysterious message by a carrier pigeon. The message gave her an e-mail address and instructed her to log in immediately, saying that she would know the password. As the message said, she knew the password immediately.\n\nIn her inbox, Maddison found information for YouTube, Revver, Lonelygirl15, and MySpace accounts that had all been set up in her name the day before. She also found an e-mail from a &quot;Mr. Zipp&quot;, apparently the same person who sent Maddison the message and set up the accounts. In the e-mail, he described himself as a &quot;worried parent with certain people watching [his] every move who impose[d] severe restrictions on [his] interactions with [his] only child&quot; and asked for her help to &quot;save [his] child&amp;#039;s life.&quot; \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:951dee0a60342345df9588fd2a5bc018e1cad9db","amp;dn":"Maddison.Atkins.....If.You.Can.Help.DVDR-12thstreethouse","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"951dee0a60342345df9588fd2a5bc018e1cad9db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,29,238,10,96,52,35,69,223,149,136,253,42,91,192,24,225,202,217,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
