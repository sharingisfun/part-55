(Add/Remove programs or 3rd Party Uninstall)\n\tB) Check Program Directory for left behind files \tC:\\_Programs\\{Program}\n\tC) Check Start Menu - Program - Folder. \n\tD) Delete .ico file from this folder :\t\t\tC:\\_\\_Installed\n\n*** This program + All (Silent) Installs by KTMDave7 :\n\tA) Are my Personal Installs, They are Tested and are for Win XP Pro (32 bit) OS.\n\t   Some MAY or MAYNOT work with Win2000, x64, or Vista.\n\tB) Are Compressed with WinRAR (SFX mode). Simply run the Compressed &amp;#039;(Silent).exe&amp;#039; file to install.\n           You could also Extract it, Edit files or not, and run &amp;#039;_Install.cmd&amp;#039;\n\tC) Get installed to this folder :\tC:\\_Programs\n\tD) Add a Icon to this folder :\t\tC:_\\_Installed\n\tE) Run a Windows Sound when Finished.\t{it will play this file %WINDIR%\\Media\\&quot;Windows XP Logon Sound.wav&quot;}\n\t   Some Programs will Sound out fast, others may take longer to install sound out.\n\t   Longer Installs (Example are) DirectX, .Net FrameWork, Guitar Pro v5.2, etc\n        F) Most have a Folder inside the Program Directory Called &quot;_&quot; which has\n\t   Info, Registry Info, Orca Info, Cracks, KeyGens, Internet Shortcuts, etc)\n\t   It is a GOOD IDEA to Open this Folder and chack out what is inside.\n\t   Some have lots of info, some not much. It is in there mainly for me when a Newer version is out.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b25067a92993105d1b2c6160963e9ebdcbe379b0","amp;dn":"DVDFab+Platinum+v5.0.2.0+by+KTMDave7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b25067a92993105d1b2c6160963e9ebdcbe379b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,80,103,169,41,147,16,93,27,44,97,96,150,62,158,189,203,227,121,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
