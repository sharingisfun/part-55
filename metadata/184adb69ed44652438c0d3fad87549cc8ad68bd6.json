I probably would like to have a share. Furthermore do whatever you like with these tracks.\n\n\n-= Description =-\n\nHere&amp;#039;s a collection of some of the cinematic triphop breakbeat fusion ethnic stuff that I&amp;#039;ve made over the past few years. I really hope you like it. If you do, check out the following links:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.radioheadremix.com/remix/?id=1826&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.radioheadremix.com/remix/?id=1826&lt;/a&gt; (My Radiohead remix, also included in the collection) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.izmarmusic.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.izmarmusic.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI have never felt completely comfortable with the music industry. I&amp;#039;ve had several small releases in the normal industry, and I will continue to do so with a small portion of my music, for various reasons that are unique to this way of distribution. Over 90% of my music, however, can be found for free on the net (http://www.mono211.com and http://www.archive.org for example), and I intend to keep releasing most of my stuff this way. I don&amp;#039;t want money to be such a big factor when it comes to music, so I experiment with other channels--hence this torrent.\n\nEnjoy!\nIzmar &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.izmarmusic.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.izmarmusic.com&lt;/a&gt; - Composer, producer &amp; ethnobotanist","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:184adb69ed44652438c0d3fad87549cc8ad68bd6","amp;dn":"Izmar+-+I+Love+P2P+%282008+Chillout-Triphop%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"184adb69ed44652438c0d3fad87549cc8ad68bd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,74,219,105,237,68,101,36,56,192,211,250,216,117,73,204,138,214,139,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
