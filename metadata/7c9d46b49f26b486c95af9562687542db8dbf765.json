It was, albeit loosely, based on the British TV series Robin&amp;#039;s Nest, just as Three&amp;#039;s Company had been based on a British series, Man About the House (Robin&amp;#039;s Nest had been a spin-off of Man About the House).\n\nIn Three&amp;#039;s a Crowd, Jack Tripper (played by John Ritter), the lead character from from Three&amp;#039;s Company, lived with his stewardess girlfriend Vicky Bradford (played by Mary Cadorette), but her father (played by Robert Mandan) didn&amp;#039;t approve of him and was constantly trying to disrupt their relationship. Rounding out the cast was Alan Campbell as E.Z. Taylor, Jack&amp;#039;s &quot;surfer dude&quot; assistant chef at his bistro; and Jessica Walter as Claudia Bradford, Vicky&amp;#039;s mother and James&amp;#039; ex-wife.\n\nUnlike the very popular Three&amp;#039;s Company, which lasted eight seasons, Three&amp;#039;s a Crowd was canceled after only one season. It was broadcast on the ABC network from September 25, 1984 until April 9, 1985, with reruns appearing in prime time until September 10, 1985.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c9d46b49f26b486c95af9562687542db8dbf765","amp;dn":"Three%5C%27s+Company+-+Threes+a+Crowd+-+S01E01+-+Pilot","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c9d46b49f26b486c95af9562687542db8dbf765","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,157,70,180,159,38,180,134,201,90,249,86,38,135,84,45,184,219,247,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
