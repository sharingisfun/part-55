The volume stands as the only available compilation of easy to use analytically-based solutions for micro-scale heat and fluid flow problems, that systematically incorporates the most relevant micro-scale effects into the mathematical models, followed by their physical interpretation on the micro-system behavior","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:907b822fbb3e2916d171b3cb08c7813059eee041","amp;dn":"Analytical+Heat+and+Fluid+Flow+in+Microchannels+and+Microsystems","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"907b822fbb3e2916d171b3cb08c7813059eee041","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,123,130,47,187,62,41,22,209,113,179,203,8,199,129,48,89,238,224,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
