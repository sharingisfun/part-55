Julia Stiles, David Strathairn, Scott Glenn, Paddy Considine, Edgar Ramirez, \n\nAlbert Finney, and Joan Allen co-star. The key cast members reprise their roles from the \n\ntwo previous Bourne movies, with additions such as Strathairn, playing a CIA department \n\nhead; Considine as a British journalist; and Ramirez as a new assassin sent to kill \n\nBourne. The film continues the saga of Jason Bourne after he apologizes to the daughter of \n\nVladimir Neski in Moscow, Russia, and follows the character as he travels to Paris, \n\nLondon, Madrid, Tangier, and New York City to uncover his real identity, while the CIA \n\ncontinues to send assassins after him.\n\nNOTE:\n\nThis being my first ever torrent, I ripped one of my favourite DVDs and put it up here. \n\nHope you like it, if you want the other two of the trilogy I got them as well and will \n\nupload if anyone wants them. Put up any suggestion that you think is appropriate about the \n\nquality or anything that comes to mind.
