Directors Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady wisely chose to avoid the polemical tone of most politically-motivated films, and instead opt to present a mostly unfiltered glimpse of this odd subculture. But through carefully selected images and the use of talk radio commentary as a framing device, they construct a subtle, yet damning narrative about a religious movement that isolates its children from mainstream culture, indoctrinates them into right-wing causes, and uses them as political props.\n\nformat: AVI\n\nlength: 87 minutes\n\nquality: crazy right wing christian in missouri...\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3fdd0fb477fd83780a1fe8e2c94c8f237bc7cfe","amp;dn":"Jesus+Camp+-+Documentary+2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3fdd0fb477fd83780a1fe8e2c94c8f237bc7cfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,253,208,251,71,127,216,55,128,161,254,142,44,148,200,242,55,188,124,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
