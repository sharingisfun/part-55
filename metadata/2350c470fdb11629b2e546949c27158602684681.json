Here the electric guitar solo, while dated-sounding, shows off the superb skill of special guest Anton Drennan, while Maire Brennan&amp;#039;s voice is particularly inspired.\n\nOther hits, such as &quot;Theme from Harry&amp;#039;s Game&quot; and &quot;Robin (The Hooded Man)&quot; come from music Clannad recorded for theeponymous British television series. The former, with its lush vocal choir, is one of the band&amp;#039;s most haunting ambient/new age tunes. Finally, &quot;Something to Believe In&quot; features the vocals and piano playing of Bruce Hornsby, and is smartlyco-produced by former Jackson Browne drummer, Russ Kunkel. A must for fans, PASTPRESENT is also a good starting point for neophytes.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n1. Harry&amp;#039;s Game\n2. Closer To Your Heart\n3. Almost Seems (Too Late To Turn)\n4. Hunter\n5.
