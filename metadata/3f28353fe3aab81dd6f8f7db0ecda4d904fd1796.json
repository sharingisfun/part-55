Well, that&amp;#039;s been the best possible \nresult.\n\nAs a bonus, I&amp;#039;ve also included an english documentary of about 10 minutes, which \nwas only available on a fifth disc, exclusive to Best Buy stores, when the \ntrilogy was originally released.  No subs for that, sorry.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f28353fe3aab81dd6f8f7db0ecda4d904fd1796","amp;dn":"Indiana+Jones+-+Making+The+Trilogy+%5BRePoPo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f28353fe3aab81dd6f8f7db0ecda4d904fd1796","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,40,53,63,227,170,184,29,214,248,247,219,14,205,164,217,4,253,23,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
