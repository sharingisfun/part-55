On we go.  A nice break in Chicago, but it&amp;#039;s a long way to Paris, so we&amp;#039;d better get started.  \n\nBeen sitting on this one for a while, not sure if it&amp;#039;s still relevant or not but it&amp;#039;s the next in the series and I&amp;#039;m sure with all the discussion about it, there&amp;#039;ll be some folks who didn&amp;#039;t get it when it came around.  What is it, you say?  Paris 10.10.69, the FM broadcast from 11.07.07.  You&amp;#039;ll ask me, someone will I&amp;#039;m sure, why, TimD?  Why the version with the DJ still on it?  Why not one of the recent updates?  Well, some of us like it - the DJ really isn&amp;#039;t that intrusive and I don&amp;#039;t dig editing stuff out of a show.  The sound quality is pretty damn good left alone.  If anyone wants to toy with the show, feel free, but I was very satisfied with it the way I got it, so I&amp;#039;m leaving it alone.\n\nAnyway, real corker of a show - a truly electric Heartbreaker (the first live one?) and a great ICQYB, this show is more or less on par with Dallas 8.31.69 if you added Heartbreaker and rearranged the setlist a little to accommodate it.  A gem, one of the short and sweet treats of 1969 that I love to play in the truck.\n\nLed Zeppelin\n1969.10.10\nParis, L&amp;#039;Olympia\nRecorded for the show &quot;Musicorama&quot;, on french station Europe 1\nFirst broadcast : 1969.11.02\nSecond Broadcast (not complete) : 2007.11.7\nMono Recording\n\nFM --&gt; MZ RH10 (PCM mode) --&gt; Trader&amp;#039;s Little Helper --&gt; Flac 7\n\n01 - Communication Breakdown\n02 - I Can&amp;#039;t Quit You Baby\n03 - Heartbreaker\n04 - Dazed And Confused\n05 - White Summer/Black Mountain Side\n06 - You Shook Me\n07 - How Many More Times\nMoby Dick was played but not broadcasted.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ddb442fb494ef56623f3d16ff7f7b9caa9490e1","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+1969.10.10+-+Paris","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ddb442fb494ef56623f3d16ff7f7b9caa9490e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,219,68,47,180,148,239,86,98,63,61,22,255,127,123,156,170,148,144,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
