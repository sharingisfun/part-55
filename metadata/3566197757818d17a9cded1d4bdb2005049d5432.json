Kennedy was slain in the pantry of the Los Angeles Ambassador hotel. Charged with the assassination is Sirhan Sirhan, a 24 year-old Palestinian whose notebooks repeatedly declare RFK MUST DIE! While Sirhan Sirhan recants his confession, investigatory oversights leave many questions unanswered:\n\nWhy was RFK rerouted from his original destination in the hotel straight into the path of an assassin s bullet?\nWho was the girl in the polka dot dress seen fleeing the hotel screaming We shot him, we shot him ?\nWhy was there a CIA presence at the hotel that night?\nWhy were additional bullets recovered but never entered into evidence?\n\nWriter-director Shane O Sullivan, highly skeptical of the official report, conducted his own exhaustive investigation. Through exclusive interviews with eyewitnesses and invesitgators, as well as rare archival footage and a wealth of expert testimony, this disturning documentary sheds new light on the murder of one of America&amp;#039;s most beloved politicians.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3566197757818d17a9cded1d4bdb2005049d5432","amp;dn":"RFK+Must+Die+DVDrip+Xvid+Shane+O+Sullivan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3566197757818d17a9cded1d4bdb2005049d5432","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,102,25,119,87,129,141,23,169,205,237,29,75,219,32,5,4,157,84,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
