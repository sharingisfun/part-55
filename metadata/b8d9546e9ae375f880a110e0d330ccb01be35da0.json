Blast beats, chugga chugga breakdowns, guitar harmonies that would make any In Flames fan overtly excited, and Paul Genet&amp;#039;s distinct vocal styling all help to push &quot;As If Forever Really Exists&quot; beyond the status of &quot;another metalcore release.&quot; In fact, with the release of this MCD, ARIA are surely going to turn heads, and push themselves into the forefront of today&amp;#039;s hardcore scene. ARIA are recommended if you would enjoy a mix of In Flames and Hatebreed. Check out tracks such as &quot;This Night Has Opened My Eyes, And I Will Never Sleep Again,&quot; &quot;A Gift Of Dead Flowers For My Dying Beauty&quot; and &quot;My Genesis, My Judas&quot; to grasp the brightest moments ARIA have to offer.\n\nTracklist :\n\n1.
