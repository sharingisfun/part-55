Just like the original Outlaws, this feisty crew from Belton,\nTexas, refuses to be pigeon-holed: they?re equally at home churning out\ntwo-steppers at rodeos or knocking out rockers at bike rallies. And now with\ntheir new album, Down South, they?re making the same two-fisted assault on the\nTexas airwaves. The first single, I?m Alright, showcases the rowdy yet\ngood-natured lyrics of songwriter/lead singer Jared Lightfoot, and the new\nalbum, Down South, due out from Smith Entertainment in April, includes guest\nperformances by Texas artists Keith Davis, Steve Maynard, Amanda Brown, Steve\nPalousek, and Pauline Reese, who is featured on the heart-wrenching duet, Giving\nUp the Ghost. A bit of band history: Wicked Brew?s initial EP, First Shot, lived\nup to its name: Just like the first shot of Jack on a cold Friday night, it was\na bit harsh yet still potent enough to warm you up. The band?s follow-up album,\nTwo-Faced, showcased the versatility of the band, referencing the many genres\nthat influence the band?s larger-than-life persona: Hardcore Country, Southern\nRock, Blues, Bluegrass, and even a little Reggae. Two-Faced helped launch the\nband into larger venues across the state, where Wicked Brew shared the marquee\nwith acts such as Kevin Fowler, Charlie Robison, Cory Morrow, Wade Bowen, Django\nWalker, Honeybrowne, and Morrison-Williams. The band even got to open for some\nof their heroes, including Lynyrd Skynyrd, Marshall Tucker Band, Ray Wylie\nHubbard, and David Allan Coe. Interestingly, the band?s name?Wicked Brew?was\nplucked from a poem by Jim Morrison in which the Doors singer describes his\nexperiences while downing a bottle of Texas whiskey. Now the Wicked Brew Band\nappropriately releases Down South, a new album featuring several tunes that\nshare Morrison?s intoxicating inspiration. Distilled along the highways of Texas\nand diverse as the Lone Star State itself, the songs on Down South showcase\nWicked Brew?s maturing songwriting and musicianship, and the band?s rowdy sense\nof humor. A few of these songs are sure to become anthems on the Texas Music\nscene.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c298198217792f06af8f89a380ef9203ba352c38","amp;dn":"Wicked+Brew+Band+-+Down+South+%5B2008%2FVBR194%5D-404","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c298198217792f06af8f89a380ef9203ba352c38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,152,25,130,23,121,47,6,175,143,137,163,128,239,146,3,186,53,44,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
