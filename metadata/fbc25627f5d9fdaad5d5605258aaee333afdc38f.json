Steve Rude is best known for his work on Nexus (with Mike Baron) and also The Moth. \n\nI have included Mister Miracle Special 1, Superman vs Hulk, X-Men: Children of the Atom 1-6 (1-3 only, have Steve Rude art, but I anticipated complaints about only having the first three issues of this mini), Space Ghost 1 (Comico), and Legnds of the DC Universe 14 (Jimmy Olson).\n\nI have not included comics with only Steve Rude covers, mainly comics that contain his art through out.\n\nThanks to the scanners and the original and varied sources. Thanks to all of you who pointed the way.\n\nPlease Seed. Please enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbc25627f5d9fdaad5d5605258aaee333afdc38f","amp;dn":"Steve+Rude","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbc25627f5d9fdaad5d5605258aaee333afdc38f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,194,86,39,245,217,253,170,213,213,96,82,88,170,238,51,58,253,195,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
