And how exactly does it operate?\n\nAs the race to the White House heats up, there is one policy on which all the presidential candidates can agree - the US relationship with Israel.\n\nIsrael is the world&amp;#039;s largest recipient of US aid, taking in roughly $3bn in direct assistance every year.\n\nIt is an aid relationship unlike any other in the world - and by far the most generous foreign aid programme ever between any two countries.\n\nYet for decades, the US has criticised Israel for its policy of building settlements on occupied Palestinian land.\n\nEvery president from Jimmy Carter to George Bush has warned Israel to put a halt to its settlement expansion - and yet the settlements continue to go up, and the aid money continues to pour in.\n\nHow could this be? Many have attributed it to the so-called Israel lobby - a powerful coalition of interest groups working to promote a pro-Israel agenda in Washington DC.\n\nFor Israel&amp;#039;s friends on Capitol Hill it can mean tens - sometimes hundreds - of thousands of dollars worth of campaign contributions from political action committees.\n\nFor Israel&amp;#039;s enemies? It can mean the end of a political career.\n\nSo just how powerful is the pro-Israel lobby in America, and where is US policy heading from here?\n\nRepost everywhere!\nCap shunster\t\npart 2\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6f0cabf1bf55e0507d4679c507e6383ea884bba","amp;dn":"Frontline+USA+-+Lobbying+for+Israel+-+05+April+08+avi%09","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6f0cabf1bf55e0507d4679c507e6383ea884bba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,240,202,191,27,245,94,5,7,212,103,156,80,126,99,131,234,136,75,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
