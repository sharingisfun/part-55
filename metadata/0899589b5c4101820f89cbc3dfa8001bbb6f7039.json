From their new found planet the human colonists watch with joy as their remote controlled power-bikes wreak havoc through their ancient cities. There is only one winner, the first to cross the line? or the last to survive. An impressive array of defensive and offensive weapons is available on-track to achieve this. These include multi-homing/reverse missiles, magnetic/laser mines. Special weapons can also be found such as invisibility, phosphorus flash and the mighty Wally-Warp which if not avoided, can instantly transport a bike right to the back of the pack.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0899589b5c4101820f89cbc3dfa8001bbb6f7039","amp;dn":"Extreme+G+%5BPAL+-+Wii+-+VC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0899589b5c4101820f89cbc3dfa8001bbb6f7039","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,153,88,155,92,65,1,130,15,137,203,195,223,168,0,27,187,111,112,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
