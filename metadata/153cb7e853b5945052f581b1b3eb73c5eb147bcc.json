While Iranian, Libyan, and Iraqi sponsorship of terror is now well accepted, it is less often said that democratic governments have also been tempted to follow the same route against their enemies.\n\nThe film reveals the extent of American backing of the Contras in Nicaragua. Another aspect of terrorism is illustrated by the terrible human tragedies resulting from ArgentinaÃƒÅ Ã‚Â¼s Dirty War of the late ÃƒÅ Ã‚Â½70s and ÃƒÅ Ã‚Â½80s. In concluding, the film briefly returns to the Middle East. Finally, we look at the lessons to be learnt from the Age of Terror for governments, the terrorists, and us ordinary citizens.\n\nActual footage of the events and interviews with many of the surviving terrorists provide a profound, multi-sided examination of the story of terrorism.\n\nThe four parts [in separate torrents] are\n1 - In the Name of Liberation\n2 - In the Name of Revolution\n3 - In the Name of God\n4 - In the Name of the State\n\n\nDirected and written by Jon Blair and Daniel Korn.\nreference link: http://thebox.bz/forums.php?action=viewtopic&amp;topicid=9158\n\nshunster\n\nAll at\nunder docs, if you are missing some.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:153cb7e853b5945052f581b1b3eb73c5eb147bcc","amp;dn":"The+Age+of+Terror+4%2F4+-+In+the+Name+of+the+State+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"153cb7e853b5945052f581b1b3eb73c5eb147bcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,60,183,232,83,181,148,80,82,245,129,177,179,235,115,197,235,20,123,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
