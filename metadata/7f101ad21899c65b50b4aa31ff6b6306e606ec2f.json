Two selections are with a trio (bassist Oscar Pettiford joins Charles on &quot;Black Coffee&quot;), while the other six are with a septet taken from his big band of the period. Key among the sidemen are David Newman (soloing on both tenor and alto) and trumpeter Joseph Bridgewater; highlights include Quincy Jones&amp;#039; &quot;The Ray,&quot; &quot;My Melancholy Baby,&quot; &quot;Doodlin&amp;#039;,&quot; and &quot;Undecided.&quot; Ray Charles should have recorded in this setting more often in his later years.\n\n\n\n\n01.
