This 12 track album was produced by Grammy-Nominated producer, Brett Beavers and \n\nfeatures guest contributors Keith Urban, Tommy Emmanuel and Buddy Miller. While Britt&amp;#039;s first two albums were traditional country \n\nrecords, her creative desire to grow professionally as an artist and a woman is evident on this album. Catherine co-wrote nine songs; \n\nall of which explore the conflicting emotions that come with self-doubt, being in love and living in a city filled with ever-changing \n\nchallenges and opportunities. Throughout the album she exposes her vulnerabilities, fears, regrets and mistakes - most notably in the \n\nremarkably honest &amp;#039;What I Did Last Night&amp;#039;. She also reveals a sexiness in &amp;#039;Little Wildflower&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Lucky Girl&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;You&amp;#039;re The One I Love&amp;#039;. This \n\nCD is her most honest, revealing and contemporary album to date. It&amp;#039;s an album young women will relate to and an album people of all \n\nages will grow to love and appreciate. She has toured with US superstars Brooks &amp; Dunn as well as Alan Jackson.\n\n\nInformation Disc:\n\n? Artist:    Catherine Britt\n? Title:     Little Wildflower\n? Year:     2008\n?
