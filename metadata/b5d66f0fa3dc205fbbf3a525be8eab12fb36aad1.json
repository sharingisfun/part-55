The supremacy of the state is sustained by covert operations, \nblack budgets and undercover agents. They are the essence of fascism and \nthe national security state, and therefore they must be exposed and examined\nby the individuals they are designed to suppress if they are to be stopped.\n\nThis compilation attempts to give an such an examination by exposing how \nfascism did not disappear after WWII, but in fact became integrated into the \ncapitalist system of government embodied by the United States of America. \nThe last fifty years of US history has seen the rise and fall of the cold war, \na war on drugs, coups, assassination and government sponsored terrorism. \n\nThis is not a coincidence, but an engineered pattern created to imposed fear,\noppression and to maintain an status quo of the ruling class elite. It is only\neffective if it is feared, repressed and denied. It is time to make the invisible \nvisible, to expose its deception and turn the tide of deceit once and for all.\n\n\n\nOn Contents ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ \n---------------------\n\nFeatures researchers such as Alex Jones, Mae Brussel, Daave Emory, Gary Webb, \nJohn Buchanon, Daniel Hopsicker, Webster Tarpley, Bill Cooper, Michael Rupert,\nIndira Sighn, Greg Szymanski, Scott Horton, Michael Parenti and John Hankey. \nTopics include Project Paperclip, the National Security Act of 1947, War on Drugs,\nFalse Flag Terrorism, 911, The Secret Government and The Assassination of JFK.\n\n\nDocument Archives:\n------------------------\n\nA Nazi in Exile , Martin Borman - by Paul Manning 1981\nAll Honorable Men by James Stewart Martin\nArmies of Spies by Joseph Gollomb, 1939htm\nBenito Mussolini - What is Fascism 1932\nCairo to Damascus by John Roy Carlson, 1951\nCol.
