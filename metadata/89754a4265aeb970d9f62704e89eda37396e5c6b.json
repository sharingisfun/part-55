He&amp;#039;s equally comfortable, however, taking on then-current targets like stoned FM disc jockeys and inane television commercials, or whimsically making fun of late-19th century president James Garfield. Because so many of his sources are so common to the American experience ÃƒÂ¢?? neurotic schoolteachers, the idiocy of mainstream media, and starting your car in the dead of winter ÃƒÂ¢?? the jokes remain funny decades later. \n   \n\n       01  Civil Defense (No Talking)    3:07  \n       02  Public School    1:56  \n       03  School Lunch    1:50  \n       04  The Sex Impulse    4:00  \n       05  &quot;Fabulous 50&amp;#039;s&quot;    2:45  \n       06  Substitute School Teacher    2:00  \n       07  Starting Your Car    :53  \n       08  F.M.
