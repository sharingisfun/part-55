It is mainly acoustic based folky style music, with credits to some serious instruments ('44 Martin, 53 Gibson J50, '78 Gretch, '64 Fender Precision bass, '58 Les Paul Junior, '63 Telecaster, Fender Rhodes, '63 Hofner bass etc. \r\n\r\nNone of this would be important unless the recording and production justified the use of these exotica-and it most certainly does. Sleepy Little Sailor in particular is one of the best recorded albums of its genre I have ever heard, and although not an audio chestnut like Diana Krall etc, on the right system it can sound near perfect. \r\n\r\nBut the reason to give these albums a punt is not the sound...its the music! And the music is excellent","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7956823bbd45ddebf403e52bb986bfa20b99554","amp;dn":"Oh+Susannah-3+CDs%3B+Sleepy+Little+Sailor%2C+Johnstown%2C+self+titled+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7956823bbd45ddebf403e52bb986bfa20b99554","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,149,104,35,187,212,93,222,191,64,62,82,187,152,107,250,32,185,149,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
