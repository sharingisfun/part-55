Contracted to A&amp;M Records during 2007, on November 23th 2007, Duffy performed on the BBC2 television show Later with Jools Holland, which resulted in a second appearance on the related New Year&amp;#039;s Eve show Hootenanny, on which, among other things, she performed with soul legend Eddie Floyd. In February 2008, she appeared on Later with Jools Holland for a third time and performed &amp;#039;Rockferry&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Mercy&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;Stepping Stone&amp;#039;. In Wales she seems set to become the &quot;pop&quot; equivalent of mezzo-soprano Katherine Jenkins. A number of commentators have remarked on her unaffected personality and natural charm. There isn&amp;#039;t exactly a dearth of female singer/songwriters in Britain at the moment, but north Wales&amp;#039; Duffy is talented enough to stand out from the pack. Duffy is the first Welsh female to achieve a number one pop single in the past 25 years.\n\n&amp;#039;Rockferry&amp;#039; is the debut album to be released by Welsh singer Duffy on March 3rd 2008. Prior to releasing the album. Rockferry, according to Duffy, is loosely based on an area that lies in between Liverpool and Chester and close to the Welsh border. Rock Ferry is situated south of Birkenhead [approximately 10 miles from the Welsh border and 3 miles from Liverpool]. As befits an album that begins with &amp;#039;Rockferry&amp;#039;, a mournful, slightly unsettling tale of moving on, and ends which &amp;#039;Distant Dreamer&amp;#039;, a soaring epic that finds Duffy contemplating &quot;all the things I&amp;#039;d like to do with my life&quot;, Rockferry is a musical journey that&amp;#039;s both sad and stirring. It&amp;#039;s a testament to Duffy&amp;#039;s remarkable talent ? particularly that tough, vulnerable, swooping voice ? that we&amp;#039;re right behind her every step of the way. There isn&amp;#039;t exactly a dearth of female singer/songwriters in Britain at the moment, but north Wales&amp;#039; Duffy is talented enough to stand out from the pack. After releasing a debut limited edition single, &amp;#039;Rockferry&amp;#039; in November 2007, Duffy then released a followup single, &amp;#039;Mercy&amp;#039;, which went straight to No.1 on download sales on February 17th  2008. The retro-soul style is given further significance by the appearance of several Northern Soul dancers in the song&amp;#039;s video.\n\nTracks:\n01  Rockferry\n02  Warwick Avenue\n03  Serious\n04  Stepping Stone\n05  Syrup &amp; Honey\n06  Hanging On Too Long\n07  Mercy\n08  Delayed Devotion\n09  I&amp;#039;m Scared\n10  Distant Dreamer\n\nTHE VIDEOS [XviD SkidVid] \nRipped from TV, edited, no logos and encoded 720x350 and 720x336 XviD \n\nDuffy - Mercy     [2008] Music Video\nDuffy - Rockferry [2008] Music Video\n\n\nEnjoy...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3250b1c95f9e40e193b3db12f1fadf691db96110","amp;dn":"Duffy+-+Rockferry+%5B2008%5D%5BCD%2BCD+Covers%2B2+Music+Videos%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3250b1c95f9e40e193b3db12f1fadf691db96110","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,80,177,201,95,158,64,225,147,179,219,18,241,250,223,105,29,185,97,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
