The thing with Leo is that \n\nhe has a very robust and at times dark and in-your-face sense of humour that can be \n\nquite refreshing and even informative if you are able to recognize it as such.\n\nWe discuss also some rather serious and pressing matters, such as the recent \n\nEarthquake in China and the recent threatening statements he made against the \n\nNorwegian Government that seemingly illegally threaten to arrest Leo once he sets \n\nfoot on Norwegian soil again. You have to remember that Leo has a toddler son, Isac \n\nRumi, with his now (soon to be) ex-wife, that he is absolutely adamant in being able \n\nto see but is being prevented by Norwegian authorities from doing so. He holds the \n\nNorwegian prime minister Jens Stoltenberg directly responsible and is cause for Leo \n\nto get very angry with him. \n\nWe talk about magic and Of course ole Lucifer and what Leo&amp;#039;s very special connection \n\nis to this rather well-known but mysterious principality demon. We talk about Bush \n\nsr. and how senile he seems to be getting. \n\nAnd of course we address Leo&amp;#039;s rather poor reception on ConCen lately, and we didn&amp;#039;t \n\neven leave out Leo&amp;#039;s past in psychiatric institutions.\n\nAnd a lot more folks, so please enjoy and try to lighten up a little when listening \n\nokay? (well that is, except perhaps for the Earthquake in China part) \n\nYour host for the day: Phil/ephilution/grinreaper\n\n------------------------\n\nTech specs:\n\nMPEG-1 layer 3 (mp3)\n64kbit\n48000Hz Mono\nPLaytime: 5245 (87m24s)\n\n===============================================================================\nOur leaders lie, cheat, steal and kill with virtual impunity.
