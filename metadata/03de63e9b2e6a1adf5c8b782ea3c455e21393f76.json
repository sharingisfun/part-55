Speed up computer start time. Increase Internet speed, optimize your internet Explorer, Firefox and E-mail programs.\n\nBoost Speed will clean up disks and the Registry to speed up your computer and tweak Windows to its peak performance.\n\nThe Remedy For a Slow Computer\n\nThis is so typical. We buy a new PC and soon it slows down to a crawl. Sometimes we just expect too much perhaps. But all too often, the computer is really running slow.\n\nWhy? Remnants of programs you once installed are now clogging the memory and disks. The Windows Registry is filled with junk and rarely defragmented. To top it all, Windows runs services you don&amp;#039;t need.\n\nLuckily for us, computer owners, most of these problems can be reversed. Auslogics BoostSpeed can speed up your computer by cleaning up and defragmenting disks and the Registry, removing bloated software, and applying performance tweaks.\n\nSo, How Much Faster Can A Slow Computer Become?\n\nWe tested BoostSpeed on a 2-year old notebook to see how the program can speed up a laptop. Tests with WinBench software show 10%-100% improvement to overall laptop performance after all the clean up has been done (click on the picture to see the results).\n\nAs you can see, Internet speed was greatly increased using several techniques. Memory usage, computer start up and shutdown speed, opening a Word document - all went noticeably faster than before optimization. Results vary on different computers and some people report &quot;unbelievable results&quot;, while others simply use the program for daily computer maintenance.\n\nBoostSpeed Integrator:\nBoostSpeed Integrator provides you with computer optimization and security summary, prompting you to take actions when needed. Use Tasks menu on the left to launch various BoostSpeed tools to clean-up, optimize and secure your computer.\n\nDisk Defrag:\nA new and improved version of Disk Defrag is now part of Auslogics BoostSpeed. You don&amp;#039;t need to have Disk Defrag installed as a separate program anymore. Simply download and install new Auslogics BoostSpeed 4 and enjoy an integrated version of Disk Defrag on your computer.\n\nSpeed Up Internet:\nInternet Optimization wizard is now easier to use, provides more information and is more powerful than before. Unlike other similar programs, Auslogics Internet Optimizer will first test your connection settings before applying any changes.\n\nOne-Button Checkup:\nIf you don&amp;#039;t have time to go through many tools in Auslogics BoostSpeed, but need a quick fix of major problems, use One-Button Checkup instead. This safe and fast program will clean and optimize your disk and the registry, as well as protect your computer.\n\nDisk Cleaner:\nDisk Cleaner, Registry Cleaner and Track Eraser are all built to scan and clean your computer, removing junk files, broken registry keys and sensitive information. Novice users will find them easy to use, and power users will be delighted by the amount of customization available.\n\nUninstall Manager:\nThe new version features greatly improved Uninstall and Startup Managers. Both can be used to improve your computer performance. Both have an edge over standard Windows tools and competitors by rating your software and giving you a Vista-style quick search.\n\nTweak Manager:\nYou can speed up, optimize and customize your computer, web browser, e-mail client and IM software using our award-winning Auslogics Tweak Manager. It allows you to search for tweaks, to see tweak rating (telling you how much effect a tweak has on your computer performance).\n\nVersion 4.1.3.121 (05/05/2008)\n* Internet Speed Optimizer now supports FireFox\n* Registry Cleaner is now compatible with many more popular programs\n* Stability improvements in Track Eraser and Disk Wiper\n* Other minor and cosmetic fixes\n\nSystem Requirements\n* Vista/XP/2000/2003 (32-bit and 64-bit supported)\n* 32 Mb of RAM\n* 50 Mb of available disk space\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03de63e9b2e6a1adf5c8b782ea3c455e21393f76","amp;dn":"Auslogics.BoostSpeed.v4.1.3.121","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03de63e9b2e6a1adf5c8b782ea3c455e21393f76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,222,99,233,178,230,161,173,245,200,183,130,234,60,69,94,33,57,63,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
