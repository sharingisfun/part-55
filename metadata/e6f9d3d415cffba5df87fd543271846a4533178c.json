In This first season we follow the baltimore-police homicide unit and the investigation of a drug war and a murder- that culminates a complicated and dangerous wire- and surveillance operation. The show is told both from the policceÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s perspective and the criminals and the viewer get to follow characters from both sides of the law- in a world where the lines between good and evil has been erased.\n\nStarring: Dominic West, John Doman, Idris Elba, Frankie R. Faison, Larry Gilliard, Wood Harris, Deirore Lovejoy, Wendell Pierce, Lance Reddick, Andre Royo and Sonja Sohn.\n\nMy Comment: Th Wire is, toghether with The Sopranos, one of my favorite shows on television ever. ItÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s a very realistic drama filled with intresting and lovable characters. The 5th and last season just ended on television and i felt i wanted to share this fantastic show. When i started to watch it I didnÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´t know where to find a torrent with it, so i had to buy the DVD. I now upload this first CD so that you donÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´t have to go through the same thing.\n\nSpoken Languages: English, French\n\nSubtitles: English, Swedish, Norweigan, Finnish, French, Portugese, Nederlands, Magyar, Romaneste, Engslish for the hearing impaired.\n\nRegion: PAL\n\nRelease Date: 2002","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6f9d3d415cffba5df87fd543271846a4533178c","amp;dn":"The.Wire.S01.E01-03.MULTISUBS.PAL.DVD9-Fallas999","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6f9d3d415cffba5df87fd543271846a4533178c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,249,211,212,21,207,251,165,223,135,253,84,50,113,132,106,69,51,23,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
