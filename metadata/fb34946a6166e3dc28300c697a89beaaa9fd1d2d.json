It is of musical significance, however, because it was essentially intended to be the fifth studio album by UK band All About Eve. In the aftermath of the Ultraviolet album's release - its bad reception and lost recording contract - whilst this album was being recorded in early 1993, lead singer Julianne Regan left the band, and All About Eve disbanded.[1]\r\n\r\nThe remaining members of the group, Andy Cousin (bass), Mark Price (drums), and Marty Willson-Piper (guitars and - on this record - lead vocals), continued their work on the album. It was released four years later on the Swedish Border Music label,[2] as a limited pressing.\r\n\r\nIn 1999, following the reformation of All About Eve, renewed interest in the band saw a re-release of the album in an limited pressing of 500 copies. Nearly all of them were sold at All About Eve gigs during their Fairy Light Nights period","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb34946a6166e3dc28300c697a89beaaa9fd1d2d","amp;dn":"All+About+Eve+and+Seeing+Stars+Discog","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb34946a6166e3dc28300c697a89beaaa9fd1d2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,52,148,106,97,102,227,220,40,48,12,105,122,137,190,170,169,253,29,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
