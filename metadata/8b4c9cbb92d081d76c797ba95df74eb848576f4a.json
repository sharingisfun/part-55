The current band members are TJ Harris (vocalist/guitarist), Jason Weekly (bassist), Chris Burrow (drummer), and Derek Drye (guitarist). They released their first CD, Fighting Instinct, in the summer of 2006. The first single off this album, &quot;I Found Forever,&quot; was featured on both rock and Christian radio stations. &quot;I Found Forever&quot; rose to 31 on the active rock charts with virtually no touring due to CAA, a lagging booking agency. Without being well known, the band&amp;#039;s christian single, &quot;Back to You&quot; soared to number 5 on the christian CHR charts. &quot;Back to You&quot; and &quot;Just to Please You,&quot; were only released to Christian radio stations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b4c9cbb92d081d76c797ba95df74eb848576f4a","amp;dn":"Fighting+Instinct","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b4c9cbb92d081d76c797ba95df74eb848576f4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,76,156,187,146,208,129,215,108,121,123,169,93,247,78,184,72,87,111,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
