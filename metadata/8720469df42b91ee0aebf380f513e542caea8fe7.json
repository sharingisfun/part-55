It is an unreleased demo for the song Burn Like The Sun by Pale divine from St Louis. Rumor is that this is one of many songs they did demo&amp;#039;s for after the release of Straight To Goodbye hence the sound quality. There is no denying that Pale Divine should have been huge in the music world. Few band are better live than the studio but Pale Divine was 100% better live. I hope to locate other demo&amp;#039;s.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8720469df42b91ee0aebf380f513e542caea8fe7","amp;dn":"Unreleased+Pale+Divine+Demo+Burn+Like+The+Sun","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8720469df42b91ee0aebf380f513e542caea8fe7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,32,70,157,244,43,145,238,10,235,243,128,245,19,229,66,202,234,143,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
