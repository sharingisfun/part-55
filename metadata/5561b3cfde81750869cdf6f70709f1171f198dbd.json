His life, set in 1849 against the backdrop of the California Gold Rush, is one long parade of amazing sex, dynamite montages, whiskey, and explosive gunfights. The kinds of things men could do when men were actually men. He is the richest man in townâ€”equal parts loved and feared by all. But when the SchlÃ¤ger Brothers come to town, so too comes the end of the good times. St. James is forced to defend everything that matters to him (including, but not limited to: prostitutes, his horse, money, and drugs. Oh, and his wife and children too, sort of). God help anyone who stands in his way","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5561b3cfde81750869cdf6f70709f1171f198dbd","amp;dn":"At+Night+She+Cries%2C+While+He+Rides+His+Steed+-+Ross+Patterson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5561b3cfde81750869cdf6f70709f1171f198dbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,97,179,207,222,129,117,8,105,205,246,247,7,9,241,23,31,25,141,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
