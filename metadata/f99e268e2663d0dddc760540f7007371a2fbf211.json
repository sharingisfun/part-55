Developing love and care for yourselves\nis your first priority. People will say, &quot;love-compassion is loving oth-\ners and caring for others.&quot; True! But, that doesn&amp;#039;t mean that I&amp;#039;m not\nincluded. In the sixty years I have read Tibetan prayers, everywhere it\nsays, &quot;I and all sentient beings, etc.&quot; It all begins with &quot;I and all others.&quot;\nIt never said, &quot;All beings except me.&quot; So, helping yourself and develop-\ning compassion for yourself, are the first urgent priorities for us.\n    If we can develop compassion for ourselves, then it is easy to de-\nvelop compassion for others. If you try to develop compassion for\nothers and ignore yourself, I don&amp;#039;t think you will ever develop com-\npassion at all. You will feel pity when looking at people suffering -- at\nbeings suffering, like a dog or a cat when a car runs over them.\nYou&amp;#039;ll feel sad, but I don&amp;#039;t know if that&amp;#039;s being compassionate; it&amp;#039;s\npity feelings we develop. We may call that compassion, but it&amp;#039;s not\nreally true compassion. What true compassion is we&amp;#039;ll try to talk\nabout this week. But, already I tell you here: if you don&amp;#039;t develop\ncompassion for yourself, it will not appear. It is not an automatic\nthing. It has to be developed. If you don&amp;#039;t develop compassion for\nyourself, then forget about developing compassion for others; there&amp;#039;s\nno way it&amp;#039;s going to happen. Atisha, the famous Bengalian scholar\nwho came to Tibet in the 1100s to bring the true message of the\nBuddha, said,\n      Until you help yourself, until you develop yourself,\n      and attend to your mind,\n      you&amp;#039;ll never be able to attend to others&amp;#039;minds.\nSo, our first priority is to develop love and care for ourselves. We do\ncare for ourselves, but often not in the correct way. Atisha also says,\n      Don&amp;#039;t think &quot;I did this. I did that.&quot;\n      Think, &quot;Others did this. Others did that.&quot;\n      Have respect for everybody.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f99e268e2663d0dddc760540f7007371a2fbf211","amp;dn":"SEM%3A+THE+NATURE+OF+MIND","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f99e268e2663d0dddc760540f7007371a2fbf211","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,158,38,142,38,99,208,221,220,118,5,64,247,0,115,113,162,251,242,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
