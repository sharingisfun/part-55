A bunch of people are quarantined on an island (which contains a graveyard) by the plague. A general (Boris Karloff) is in charge, but people dying from the plague, the isolation and close quarters begin to eat away at him. He starts to believe a young, healthy woman among them is a vorvolaka (a vampire). And there&amp;#039;s the woman who has an extreme fear of being buried alive...\n\nQuick paced and very literate horror film. There&amp;#039;s lots of dialogue about faith, wars, superstition--all of it interesting. The settings are very dark, eerie with a spooky wind always blowing. There are scary moments throughout but they really shift into high gear during the final 15 minutes.\n\nThis movie gave me nightmares when I was little! The cast is adequate (except for Jason Robards Sr.--boy, was he annoying!) but Karloff and Katherine Emery were excellent.\n\nTruly frightening old horror film. A definite must-see.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://fatfuckfrank.org/index.php?topic=950.0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://fatfuckfrank.org/index.php?topic=950.0&lt;/a&gt;\n\nsee a young Boris Karloff before the mad hairy pussy took over his life\n\n\nlater/FFF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6efc61df33f62672934c8bb2d18e651103eff0c","amp;dn":"Isle+Of+Thead+1945....FFF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6efc61df33f62672934c8bb2d18e651103eff0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,239,198,29,243,63,98,103,41,52,200,187,45,24,230,81,16,62,255,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
