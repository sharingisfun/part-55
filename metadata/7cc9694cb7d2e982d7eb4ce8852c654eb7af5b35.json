That said, it&amp;#039;s a far better album than the patchy debut; the songs, again by brother Rikki Wilde with occasional collaborations by father Marty Wilde, don&amp;#039;t have the bubblegum tinge that colored much of 1981&amp;#039;s Kim Wilde. The arrangements are more synth-oriented, at times approaching the dark atmospherics of Japan or Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. The occasionally melodramatic lyrics cover topics like police brutality and paranoia ÃƒÂ¢?? unsurprisingly, new insights aren&amp;#039;t much in evidence ÃƒÂ¢?? and even the love songs, like the delicate &quot;View from a Bridge,&quot; aren&amp;#039;t exactly happy. The overall vibe of this album is so chilly that the one basically upbeat song, &quot;Can You Come Over,&quot; sounds really out of place, but overall, it works. Wilde sings with a clinical detachment here that suits her voice quite well; whenever Wilde tries to emote musically, the results sound forced and melodramatic, but her icy edge on this album is surprisingly appealing. \n\n\n---------------------\n\n\nRemastered version contains the B Sides:\n\n- Child Come Away\n- Just Another Guy\n- Watching For Shapes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cc9694cb7d2e982d7eb4ce8852c654eb7af5b35","amp;dn":"Kim+Wilde+-+Select++%5BRemastered+Bonus+Tracks%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cc9694cb7d2e982d7eb4ce8852c654eb7af5b35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,201,105,76,183,210,233,130,215,235,76,232,133,44,101,78,183,175,91,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
