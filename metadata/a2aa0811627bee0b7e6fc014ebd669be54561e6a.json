It was filmed over the course of a year at the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew.\r\n\r\nThe series premiered on 26 May 2012 on the Sky 3D network in the UK, with a 2D simulcast on Sky Atlantic HD. An IMAX cinema release is also planned.\r\n\r\nEach of the three episodes explores a different aspect of plant life. &quot;Life in the Wet Zone&quot; explains how plants first colonised wet and humid environments, &quot;Solving the Secrets&quot; explores plant reproductive techniques and &quot;Survival&quot; shows how plants continually adapt to their environments. The series also goes behind the scenes of Kew's Millennium Seed Bank Project.\r\n\r\nThe series makes use of multiple camera formats and employs live action, time-lapse, high-speed, infrared, macro and micro photography to bring its subjects to life. Some of these techniques were pioneered in 3D for this series.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. \tTitle \t                Original air date (UK)\r\n1 \t&quot;Life in the Wet Zone&quot; \t26 May 2012\r\n2 \t&quot;Solving the Secrets&quot; \t2 June 2012\r\n3 \t&quot;Survival&quot; \t9 June 2012\r\n\r\nVideo: h265, 1920x2160p (crf 20)\r\nAudio: opus, stereo\r\nEng, Rus \r\n+ subs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2aa0811627bee0b7e6fc014ebd669be54561e6a","amp;dn":"Kingdom+of+Plants+3D+%282012%29+Full+OU+1920x2160p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2aa0811627bee0b7e6fc014ebd669be54561e6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,170,8,17,98,123,238,11,126,111,192,20,235,214,105,190,84,86,30,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
