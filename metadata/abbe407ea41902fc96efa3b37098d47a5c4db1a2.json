With a contract now out on him, Milo hides out in a remote Welsh village assuming the mantle of local baker in order to evade fellow killer, Bjorn (Coster-Waldau)&quot;.  \n\nuploader rating - 7/10 (as it was funny in parts but, could have been much more)\n\nQuality rating - 10/10\n\nsubtitles - none\n\nlanguage - English  \n\nThanks for downloading and seeding!\n\nChris17585 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abbe407ea41902fc96efa3b37098d47a5c4db1a2","amp;dn":"The+Baker+DVD+Rip+%2B+dvd+front+and+label","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abbe407ea41902fc96efa3b37098d47a5c4db1a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,190,64,126,164,25,2,252,150,239,163,179,112,152,212,122,92,77,177,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
