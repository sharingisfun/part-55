They had made a s/t album but due to label issues it was never released. You may of heard a few of their tracks on the film &quot;Bi0-Dome&quot;, they did the song &quot;Adirectional&quot; on the opening credits and the cover of &quot;kid&amp;#039;s in america&quot; also in the film.\n\nThis is just over half of their album (missing about 7 tracks, impossible to find) the quality of most isn&amp;#039;t great, but it isn&amp;#039;t bad either, demo quality if you will.\n\nAlso Includes their 7&quot; EP &quot;Jack Frost&quot; which was the only thing actually released by them.\n\nEnjoy and please seed!!!!\n\nThanks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de0e415db0bceb12f512ae4dd3c9ff1989f0616e","amp;dn":"Forth+Grade+Nothing+-+over+half+of+unreleased+album+and+full+7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de0e415db0bceb12f512ae4dd3c9ff1989f0616e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,14,65,93,176,188,235,18,245,18,174,77,211,201,255,25,137,240,97,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
