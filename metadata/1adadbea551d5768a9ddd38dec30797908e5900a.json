This seeking\nis an individual&amp;#039;s search for something more than self, and much more than the\nconfines of this worldly system. It is the seeker, who understands there is more\nthan what meets the eye, who is not afraid and makes the choice to go into the\nunknown. The process of awaking has begun, the discovery is underway.\n\n2008 - Alan Watt - A Course in Deprogramming\n\n\n\nAlan Watt, a leading researcher into hidden history, ancient civilizations,\nand their influence on modern society, speaks on the global agenda of the\nruling elite, the open conspiracy, the old world order made new, the temporary\npolice state leading to the chip implant, and much more.\n\nAlan Watt&amp;#039;s interviews on CuttingThroughTheMatrix are absolutely priceless.\nHis broadcasts are in a class of their own. In a world full of clones, his powerfully\noriginal presentation and unique message undoubtedly makes him a target.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cuttingthroughthematrix.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cuttingthroughthematrix.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nThis Week: week 15, 2008\n\n1.
