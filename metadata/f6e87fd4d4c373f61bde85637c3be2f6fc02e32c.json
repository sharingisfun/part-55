Toad, Mole, Rat, and Badger do their best to maintain the simple pleasures of life, even as the pesky weasels lurk nearby. Filled with music and song - and plenty of tea and jam - our gentlemanly quartet always find a way to traverse life&amp;#039;s ups and downs with aplomb. This production from the makers of Dangermouse and Count Duckula is widely considered the best and most faithful adaption of Kenneth Grahame&amp;#039;s classic book.\n\nCast:\n\nRichard Pearson ...
