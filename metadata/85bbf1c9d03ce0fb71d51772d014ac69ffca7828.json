Foobar2k was used to add ID3-tags, to avoid clipping by scaling the Global Gain to 89dB and to add ReplayGain tags. Final quality (TMB HQ): 266kbps 44.1kHz VBR stereo MP3. All MP3-players will play the file as usual. After all the optimizations, the MP3 file has been improved even more - a third (for normal stereo mp3-players invisible) channel with 17kbps 5.1 surround extension has been added with the MP3SX converter. Check the Fraunhofer explanations HERE. A software player for the MP3SX / MP3 Surround content can be found at all4mp3.com.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85bbf1c9d03ce0fb71d51772d014ac69ffca7828","amp;dn":"Matt+Darey+-+Nocturnal+Podcast+%2311+%5B256+kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85bbf1c9d03ce0fb71d51772d014ac69ffca7828","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,187,241,201,208,60,224,251,113,213,23,114,208,20,172,105,255,202,120,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
