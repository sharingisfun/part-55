Lawrence (Cambridge, 2004).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 0521782848\r\n\r\nSpecifically dedicated to the synthesis, properties and reactions of amines, this up-to-date resource demonstrates the importance of amines to life, and provides a short history of the development of ammonia synthesis and of amine chemistry from the 19th century to the present day. Practical synthetic and analytical methods are presented for laboratory preparation and detection of amines and their role in industry is reviewed. The work will be an invaluable reference for undergraduates and postgraduates, and for chemical researchers working in industry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6bce8733ac2af3f691e0d99c73c51aa931ef7ba","amp;dn":"Amines+-+Synthesis%2C+Properties+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6bce8733ac2af3f691e0d99c73c51aa931ef7ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,188,232,115,58,194,175,63,105,30,13,153,199,60,81,170,147,30,247,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
