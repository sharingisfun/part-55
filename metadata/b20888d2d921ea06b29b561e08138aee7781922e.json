Their mission is to retrieve timber perched on mountainsides too steep to access with machines, but it&amp;#039;s no easy task. Plagued by mechanical failures, relentless weather, and unpredictable terrain, these brave men risk their lives retrieving the timber with which we built our country. Meet four companies trying to survive each day. Pihl Logging--a rag-tag group of loggers based in Vernonia, Oregon. Gustafson Logging--a close-knit crew working one of the most dangerous jobs in the region. J.M. Browning--the best of the best. Stump Branch Logging--the young guns with a lot to prove. These are the Ax Men.\n\nSource: History Channel","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b20888d2d921ea06b29b561e08138aee7781922e","amp;dn":"History.Channel.Ax.Men.S01E01.WS.DSR.XviD-K4RM4.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b20888d2d921ea06b29b561e08138aee7781922e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,8,136,210,217,33,234,6,178,155,86,30,8,19,138,238,119,129,146,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
