Also they do strange things like release a open movie using a non-open encoder. I thought I could do much better. First off is the 1080 encode.\n\n1) Their MP4 is using MPEG4 ASP, which is not all that efficient of a codec. Especially with HD content. And, AVI...use a modern container!!\n2) Their h.264 encodes use the (non-open) QuickTime encoder, which is also a very very poor implementation of h.264.\n3) Theora isn&amp;#039;t the greatest codec, but at least it&amp;#039;s open. But, stereo vorbis, why?\n4) MSMPEG4, why???????\n\nSo let me present my encode:\nNOTE: I did cheat with the audio, and ripped the AC3 out of the official encode. I was planning on using the same, so why reencode.\nContainer: Matroska\nVideo Codec: x264\nVideo Bitrate: 5892kbps\nAudio Codec: AC/3\nAudio Bitrate: 448kbps\n\nFor the curious here&amp;#039;s what settings I used:\nx264 r869 with the psyrdo patch applied.\n--ref 16 --analyse all --me umh --subme 6 --b-rdo --mixed_refs --8x8dct --bframes 16 --b-pyramid --weightb --bime --pre-scenecut --crf 18\n\nThis results in a file about 1/2 the size of the official MP4 encode, but very close to source quality.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e86074b4851b2b964a1d8db9fae2e7f0b763d03","amp;dn":"Big+Buck+Bunny+1080p+%28x264%2C+ac3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e86074b4851b2b964a1d8db9fae2e7f0b763d03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,134,7,75,72,81,178,185,100,161,216,219,159,174,46,127,11,118,61,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
