Thirty-Three is pretty shaky.. I was getting pretty tired of being a human tri-pod. A minor audio errors are based on the original recording. The Audio was recored from the balcony next to my camera. \n\nSome Highlight: Billy does a lot of banter most of which are very funny. First appearance of Death From Above. Only appearance of Promise Me. Last (as of date) appearance of 7 Shades of Black &amp; Translucent. Jimmy loses his drum sticks towards the end of Doomsday Clock, and more!\n\n\nA HD 1080i BLU-RAY version currently not available for public circulation but does exist. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fcc9fd1b5724cecef559a346cabcee939098ee1","amp;dn":"The+Smashing+Pumpkins+-+July+16th+2007+LIVE+DVD+%40+the+Fillmore+i","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fcc9fd1b5724cecef559a346cabcee939098ee1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,204,159,209,181,114,76,236,239,85,154,52,108,171,206,233,57,9,142,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
