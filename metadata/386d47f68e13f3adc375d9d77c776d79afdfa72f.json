This was an afternoon gig,\n\nplaying to a bunch of zombie shoppers. A few teenage girls remarked that they\n\nunderstood what the band was &quot;trying to do&quot;. Warstars never tried. They just did.\n\nFree CDs up the yang were given out for free, as usual. The record store guy cut\n\nthe band off early, citing the volume being a problem. Are ALL people stupid and\n\nlame? No. Just asshole kids who work at record stores who listen to Oasis.\n\n\ngoogle andy warstar - visit www.andywarstar.com - for the warheads!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:386d47f68e13f3adc375d9d77c776d79afdfa72f","amp;dn":"Andy+Warstar+%26+Friends+-+10%2F20%2F02+Portland%2C+OR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"386d47f68e13f3adc375d9d77c776d79afdfa72f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,109,71,246,142,19,243,173,195,117,217,215,124,119,109,121,175,223,167,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
