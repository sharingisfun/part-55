This film shows the investigation from two perspectives: How the events actually took place and how they were portrayed to the public. This eye-opening documentary points out all the failures of Law Enforcement officials to fully investigate, follow up on leads, and interview key parties involved. Everyone believes they know the reason why Tupac s murder remains unsolved; this DVD backs it up. Everyone believes they have been deceived by certain people; this DVD documents it. By the time this DVD ends the smoke of rumours will dissipate and a clear picture will appear. MP4 format to save memory.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1587fcf25e1b21fc2f19cf31461da5d98e459539","amp;dn":"tupac+assassination+MP4+IPOD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1587fcf25e1b21fc2f19cf31461da5d98e459539","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,135,252,242,94,27,33,252,47,25,207,49,70,29,165,217,142,69,149,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
