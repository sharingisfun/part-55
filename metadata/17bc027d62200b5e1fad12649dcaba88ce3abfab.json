Although the two members\nwere not brothers, their close harmonies recalled the Everly Brothers, and\ntheir largely acoustic sound tied them to the music of the past despite their\nundeniable modernity and originality. After two excellent albums the O&amp;#039;Kanes\nreleased Imagine That, the most straightforward country album of their three,\nand the only one to fail to provide a Top 40 C&amp;W hit. Imagine That doesn&amp;#039;t\ndiffer radically from the two previous O&amp;#039;Kanes albums, but the material is\nweaker and the hypnotic quality that made the others so engaging is lacking\nhere.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17bc027d62200b5e1fad12649dcaba88ce3abfab","amp;dn":"The+OKanes-Imagine+That+%281990-Country-192k%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17bc027d62200b5e1fad12649dcaba88ce3abfab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,188,2,125,98,32,11,94,31,173,18,100,157,202,186,136,206,58,191,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
