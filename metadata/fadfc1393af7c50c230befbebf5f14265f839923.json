The main hero is a Russian soldier, Alyosha Skvortsov, one of the many who made the victory over Fascism possible. He is neither an action movie hero, nor a conqueror. This simple boy, who was panic-stricken at the first sight of an enemy tank, overcomes his fear and manages to hit two enemy machines. However, battle scenes do not take much of the film&amp;#039;s time. For his fighting exploits Alyosha is awarded a two-day&amp;#039;s leave to visit his mother. He meets many different people on his way and is ready to help everybody. That leaves him just a few minutes to spend with his mother a few words, a hug, and he is off for the front again... to never come back.\n\nCast\nVladimir Ivashov, Zhanna Prokhorenko, Antonina Maximova, Nikolai Kriuchkov, Yevgheny Urbansky\n\nAwards\nPrize for Best Competition Film Program (along with the film &quot;Lady With a Dog&quot;) and Prize for Best Film For Youth at the Cannes IFF, 1960\nGolden Gate Award - the first prize at the San Francisco IFF, 1960\nDavid Donatello Prize for the Best Foreign-Language Film in Italy\nGrand Prize at the London IFF, 1960\nOscar nomination of Valentin Yezhov and Grigory Chukhrai for Best Original Screenplay, 1961\nSpecial features\nPictures and filmography of the film&amp;#039;s authors\nCandids from the shooting ground\nAn interview with the director G.
