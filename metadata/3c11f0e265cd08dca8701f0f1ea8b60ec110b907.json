Between 1968 and 1972, the world watched in awe each time an American spacecraft voyaged to the Moon. Only 12 American men walked upon its surface and they remain the only human beings to have stood on another world. Now for the first, and very possibly the last, time, IN THE SHADOW OF THE MOON combines archival material from the original NASA film footage, much of it never before seen, with interviews with the surviving astronauts, including Jim Lovell (Apollo 8 and 13), Dave Scott (Apollo 9 and 15), John Young (Apollo 10 and 16), Gene Cernan (Apollo 10 and 17), Mike Collins (Apollo 11), Buzz Aldrin (Apollo 11), Alan Bean (Apollo 12), Edgar Mitchell (Apollo 14), Charlie Duke (Apollo 16) and Harrison Schmitt (Apollo 17). The astronauts emerge as eloquent, witty, emotional and very human.\n\nFile Name ..........: In.the.Shadow.of.the.Moon.DVDRip.XviD.AC3.avi\nTotal Size (MB) ....: 1,400.03 MB\nTotal Streams ......: 2 Stream(s)\n\nVideo Length .......: 01:39:55\nVideo Codec Name ...: XviD MPEG-4 codec\nVideo Bitrate ......: 1511 KB/s\nResolution .........: 704 x 384\nAspect Ratio .......: 1.83:1\nFramerate ..........: 23.976 FPS\nQuality Factor .....: 0.233 B/px\n\nAudio Codec Name ...: FAST Multimedia AG DVM (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate ......: 448 KB/s (CBR)\nChannels ...........: 6 Ch\nSampling Rate ......: 48000 Hz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c11f0e265cd08dca8701f0f1ea8b60ec110b907","amp;dn":"In.the.Shadow.of.the.Moon.DVDRip.XviD.AC3.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c11f0e265cd08dca8701f0f1ea8b60ec110b907","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,17,240,226,101,205,8,220,168,112,31,15,30,168,182,14,193,16,185,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
