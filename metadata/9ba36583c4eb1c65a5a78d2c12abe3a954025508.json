It is held annually in Las Vegas, lasting just over a month. A bracelet is awarded to the winner of each of the fifty-plus events which include all the major varieties of poker. The series culminates with the $10,000 no-limit hold&amp;#039;em &quot;Main Event&quot;, which in recent years has attracted entry fields numbering in the thousands, with the victor receiving a multi-million dollar prize.\n\n\nThe fundamental theorem of poker, introduced by David Sklansky, states that every time you play your hand the way you would if you could see your opponent&amp;#039;s cards, you gain, and every time your opponent plays his cards differently from the way he would play them if he could see your cards, you gain.[1] This theorem is the foundation for many poker strategy topics. For example, bluffing and slow-playing (explained below) are examples of using deception to induce your opponents to play differently than they would if they could see your cards. There are some exceptions to the fundamental theorem in certain multi-way pot situations, as described in Morton&amp;#039;s theorem.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ba36583c4eb1c65a5a78d2c12abe3a954025508","amp;dn":"Multiplayer+WSOP+Championship+Software+%2B+Texas+Holdem+The+Ultima","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ba36583c4eb1c65a5a78d2c12abe3a954025508","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,163,101,131,196,235,28,101,165,167,141,44,18,171,227,169,84,2,85,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
