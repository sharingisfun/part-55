The album's lyrics are heavily influenced by Mayan Civilization. The CD was released with copy control on it. This CD started a new &quot;saga&quot;, called A New Age Dawns. This saga is continued on the album Design Your Universe.\r\n\r\nStylistically, the album is more focused towards orchestration than other Epica releases and features heavy use of a chorus. Additionally, Mark Jansen's death growls appear less frequently, occurring on only three songs, &quot;Force of the Shore&quot;, &quot;Mother of Light&quot; and &quot;Consign to Oblivion&quot;. But a bonus track, the Death cover &quot;Crystal Mountain&quot; includes grunts, and a grunt version of &quot;Quietus&quot; was released on the &quot;Quietus (Silent Reverie)&quot; single, making it five songs with grunts.\r\n\r\nALBUM: Consign To Oblivion (Expanded Edition)\r\n\r\nYEAR: 2015\r\n\r\nCOUNTRY: Netherlands\r\n\r\nSTYLE: Power Metal\r\n\r\nDURATION: 2:07:23\r\n\r\nFORMAT: MP3\r\n\r\nQUALITY: 320 kbps \r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\n\r\n01.
