Fixed star window collision.\n4. Minor bot pathing adjustments (Location).\n5. Removed BombDeliveryGate LookTargets.\n6. Created MosqueSharkPathNode object for placing vectors in the editor instead of the code.\n7. Created MosquePelicanPathNode object for placing vectors in the editor instead of the code.\n8. Added a second pelican and re-designed both pelican paths.\n9. Added blue/red cave wall directional signs.\n10. Added a few important new bot paths to the CTF map only, to enhance CTF play.\n11. Better voice announcement for incoming pass.\n12. Dynamic NetPriority for ball, depending on its state, to avoid jerky movement\non client machines while passing (congested network issue).\n13. Fix for client side emitters, now working correctly.\n14. Jail time reduced from 15 seconds to 10 seconds.\n15. More fine tuning of bot squad AI.\n16. A few texture enhancements.\n\nAs this version of the map is now receiving some attention on public servers, those who wish to play on the net should install this version. Previous versions are no longer seeded.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b17861f5f07abf58b383246a58cc5ca7101442c9","amp;dn":"BR-Mosque1.4.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b17861f5f07abf58b383246a58cc5ca7101442c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,120,97,245,240,122,191,88,179,131,36,106,88,204,92,167,16,20,66,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
