What I mean by that is that it only plays in the XboX 360. If you put this in your XboX console you will only see a movie. Burn it with ImgBurn in a Dual Layer disk and make sure to set the booktype to DVD-ROM. At the moment is XboX Live safe. However I&amp;#039;m not sure about the future. Remember that at the moment you cannot use a Pal image in a NTSC console and viceversa. I hope you enjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40cac2a55df679b3cb89e554ea8ab56c0813b785","amp;dn":"Halo_2_XboX_game_compatible_with_XboX_360_only_NTSC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40cac2a55df679b3cb89e554ea8ab56c0813b785","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,202,194,165,93,246,121,179,203,137,229,84,234,138,181,108,8,19,183,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
