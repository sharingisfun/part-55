It has 10 songs by each artist in order for you to get to know each of them better. I try to select not only songs that are the most popular, but are also on their most recent albums since it is more likely they will be played during the actual concert. This torrent also has the trailer in mp4 or ipod format. for the song list please check the files included in the torrent. enjoy :) YOSHIPUPDUDE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fd182f449a5642a2726adaf6dd739ed89fa4941","amp;dn":"Projekt+Revolution+2008+Songs+%26+Trailer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fd182f449a5642a2726adaf6dd739ed89fa4941","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,209,130,244,73,165,100,42,39,38,173,175,109,215,57,237,137,250,73,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
