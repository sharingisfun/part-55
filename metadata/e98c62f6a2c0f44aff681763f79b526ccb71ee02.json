The second collaboration of authors Feist (the Riftwar saga) and Wurts (&quot;Cycle of Fire&quot; trilogy) combines fantasy and intrigue with an intricate and exotic world setting drawing heavily on Oriental motifs. Richly detailed and compellingly written, this sequel to Daughter of the Empire ( LJ 6/15/87) is highly recommended.\n\n\nEmpire 1 - Daughter Of The Empire: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/4125488/Empire_1_-_Daughter_Of_The_Empire_(TTS)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/4125488/Empire_1_-_Daughter_Of_The_Empire_(TTS)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e98c62f6a2c0f44aff681763f79b526ccb71ee02","amp;dn":"Empire+2+-+Servant+Of+Empire+%28TTS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e98c62f6a2c0f44aff681763f79b526ccb71ee02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,140,98,246,162,192,244,74,255,104,23,99,247,155,82,108,203,113,238,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
