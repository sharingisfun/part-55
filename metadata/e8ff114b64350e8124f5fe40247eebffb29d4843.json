The problem is that the IBM site demands tedious and longlasting registration, moreover, the server seems to be dead (too many downloaders?). Anyway, you can download it from my torrent. The program is free, so you can use when and where you want.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8ff114b64350e8124f5fe40247eebffb29d4843","amp;dn":"IBM+Lotus+Symphony+1+US+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8ff114b64350e8124f5fe40247eebffb29d4843","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,255,17,75,100,53,14,129,36,245,254,64,36,126,235,255,178,157,72,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
