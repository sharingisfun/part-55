The band celebrates its 10th anniversary this year and the promo sheet tells something like ?elite band in the worlds Black Metal Scene?. So, I?m pretty anxious then. The first view on the coverartwork let?s me smirk. There?s a guy (probably one of the band members) with corpsepaint ? that?s okay until then ? drowned in imitated blood, which has really no similarity with real blood and reminds rather of wall colour. He directs a handgun in my direction and he has apparently shot a woman, who is also shown on the cover, in her back. I don?t know, what this is all about, but I assume, that this should look evil. But it isn?t. It?s just ridiculous crap, which was made loveless, moreover, it?s much too colourful.\n\n \n\nWell, the cover hasn?t necessarily said something about the music inside. I should mention, that I don?t be a fan of all that bombast and symphony when it comes to Black Metal, I rather prefer the rough and brutal direction. What I found here is a nice album. Nice, not more or less.\n\n \n\nFirst of all: Apart from the intro, there are no keyboards, which is an advantage in my opinion, the samples are sparely used but if so, then they are well used. The vocals (courtesy of TAAKE member HÃƒÂ¸st) are finely performed, the screams are solid, there?s nothing to criticize. Same goes for the drums, a very precise and fast drumming, like you wish for on such a band. These parts of the setups are really okay throughout the whole album. The guitar department works technically well especially on the first two tracks, but there?s a lack of a certain mood. There won?t come any Black Metal feeling. But that arrives later and grows and reminds me even partly of the midwhile defunctioned IMMORTAL. Especially ?Murder? is a track, you like to listen more than one time.
