Length : 122min                \n\n\n The last time we saw Danny Ocean&amp;#039;s crew, they were paying back ruthless      \n casino mogul Terry Benedict after stealing millions from him. However, it&amp;#039;s  \n been a while since they&amp;#039;ve come back together, which is all about to         \n change. When one of their own, Reuben Tishkoff builds a hotel with known     \n casino owner Willy Banks, the last thing he ever wanted was to get cut out   \n of the deal personally by the loathsome Banks. Banks&amp;#039; attitude even goes so  \n far as to finding the amusement in Tishkoff&amp;#039;s misfortune when the double     \n crossing lands Reuben in the hospital because of a heart attack. However,    \n Danny and his crew won&amp;#039;t stand for Banks and what he&amp;#039;s done to a friend.     \n Uniting with their old enemy Benedict, who himself has a vendetta against    \n Banks, the crew is out to pull off a major plan. One that will unfold on     \n the night Banks&amp;#039; newest hot spot opens up, when the crew is out to bankrupt  \n one of the city&amp;#039;s most despised businessmen. But they&amp;#039;re not in this for     \n the money, but for the revenge.
