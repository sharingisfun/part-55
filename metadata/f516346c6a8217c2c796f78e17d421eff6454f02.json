And here, about 9 months later, is the answer.\n\nI took two shots of the same scene with my point and shoot camera to remove some moving cars (the runner shown here was just an accident. But I like the idea and will do a ?real? one soon). I used a technique similar to that shown in episode 44, only this time a bit more sophisticated using layer masks instead of the eraser.\n\nBut I had no tripod and no beanbag. So unintentionally I moved and rotated the camera between the shots. Registering (adjusting them to a perfect fit) is the largest part of the work to be done. This involves the selection of a point of reference, moving the top layer, setting the centre of rotation and finally rotating the top layer. With more than two layers this has to be repeated for each layer.\n\nI hadn?t thought that this would work out so good and easy. You can just shoot any public place without moving traffic if you make enough images. Imagine a big crossing, all traffic lights red.  ;-) And you don?t need the tripod. OK, it?s better with?.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f516346c6a8217c2c796f78e17d421eff6454f02","amp;dn":"Meet_the_Gimp_Videopodcast_Episode_035_Removing_People","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f516346c6a8217c2c796f78e17d421eff6454f02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,22,52,108,106,130,23,194,199,150,247,142,23,212,33,239,246,69,79,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
