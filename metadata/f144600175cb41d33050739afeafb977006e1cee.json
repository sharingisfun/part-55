A tough, relentless cop pursues him.\n\nCredits \nCast: Kirk Douglas \nDirector: Jeff Kanew \n\nSynopsis\nWrongly convicted of a crime, Eddie Macon breaks out of his Texas jail cell and heads for the border, in hopes of joining his wife and children in Mexico. In hot pursuit is Marzack, a cop determined to retrieve the escapee.\n\nBecause Eddie has no transportation, he has to journey the entire way on foot, and his dangerous trek takes him through the backwoods -- where a strange, deranged family nearly murders him. After managing to flee from this demented trio, Eddie meets up with Jilly Buck, a bored rich gal who agrees to help him reach his destination just because &quot;it&amp;#039;s a slow Wednesday.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f144600175cb41d33050739afeafb977006e1cee","amp;dn":"Eddie+Macon%60s+Run-80%60s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f144600175cb41d33050739afeafb977006e1cee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,68,96,1,117,203,65,211,48,80,115,154,254,175,185,119,0,110,28,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
