Kennedy Montgomery is a libertarian that you may recognize from 90's MTV, Stossel, and the Independents.\r\n\r\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\r\n\r\nTonight Kennedy is watching a fresh hell fall down upon Hillary Clinton. While she is handily beating Bernie Sanders in the polls 49 percent of Democrats say they may switch in the future. When stacked up against Carson she's polling 50 to 40 percent. (With Carson winning.) She couldn't even beat Chris Christie or Marco Rubio. Speaking of Marco Rubio he'd been making some moves and eating up that neo-con bread.\r\n\r\nThe good news for Hillary - she's likely going to win the Democratic nomination. Bad news? She's polling terribly when matched up with her potential Republican opponents. Tonight's party panel consists of TOM SHILLUE, BRIAN MORGENSTERN, and CARLY SHIMKUS and they dive right in. Rubio is coming up in the polls and Donald Trump is seeing red. Shots have been fired on both sides. Tarantino recently sparked quite the righteous outrage from butt hurt cops with some inflammatory comments. He wont apologize.\r\n\r\nJUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO has a new nickname for hillary. &quot;The Mistress of Deception&quot;. He's here to outline why he thinks this moniker is appropriate. \r\n\r\nThe panel returns to talk about the kinda creepy methods election campaigns are using to analyze vote data. It's called neuropolitics and it uses online data to examine peoples brains, bodies, and faces to determine what messages actually resonate. A study has shown that overweight people tend to have overweight pets. It's Movember! So get those mustaches out!\r\n\r\nNoted plagiarist and big fat weirdo JOSH OSTROVSKY (&quot;The Fat Jew&quot;) is here to talk about his book Money Pizza Respect, instagram, not plagiarizing, getting instagram followers by using the wrong hash tags (you fucker), and the Fat Jew's recipe for prison wine.\r\n\r\nNightcap: Drunk women goes to the zoo and gets drunk, sneaks into a zoo, and gets bitten by a tiger. Some guy hits the streets of New York to ask the question, &quot;Should the zoo be held responsible?&quot;\r\n\r\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\nComplete name : Kennedy.2015.11.04.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\r\nFormat : MPEG-4\r\nFormat profile : Base Media\r\nCodec ID : isom\r\nFile size : 252 MiB\r\nDuration : 42mn 4s\r\nOverall bit rate : 839 Kbps\r\nWriting application : Lavf56.25.101\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nID : 1\r\nFormat : AVC\r\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\r\nFormat profile :   \r\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\r\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 4 frames\r\nCodec ID : avc1\r\nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding\r\nDuration : 42mn 4s\r\nBit rate : 700 Kbps\r\nWidth : 624 pixels\r\nHeight : 352 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode : Variable\r\nFrame rate : 29.970 fps\r\nMinimum frame rate : 9.990 fps\r\nMaximum frame rate : 29.970 fps\r\nColor space : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth : 8 bits\r\nScan type : Progressive\r\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.106\r\nStream size : 211 MiB (83%)\r\nWriting library : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\r\nEncoding settings : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=700 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nID : 2\r\nFormat : AAC\r\nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\r\nFormat profile : LC\r\nCodec ID : 40\r\nDuration : 42mn 4s\r\nBit rate mode : Constant\r\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\r\nCompression mode : Lossy\r\nStream size : 38.5 MiB (15%)\r\nLanguage : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6de34c07ba0076e629d4e6b85128f0619b0a149","amp;dn":"Kennedy.2015.11.04.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6de34c07ba0076e629d4e6b85128f0619b0a149","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,222,52,192,123,160,7,110,98,157,78,107,133,18,143,6,25,176,161,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
