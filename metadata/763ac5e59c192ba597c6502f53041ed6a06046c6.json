Their self-titled album Until December was released in 1986, which contained their biggest hit &quot;Heaven&quot;. Other notable songs performed by Until December include their song &quot;Until December&quot;, &quot;Live Alone In Shame&quot; (B-Side to the 12&quot; of &quot;Until December - The Berlin Mix&quot;) and a cover of the song &quot;Bela Lugosi&amp;#039;s Dead&quot; by Bauhaus. Headed by the enigmatic Adam Shurburne, famous in the mid 80s Bay area for showing his ass off on stage, throwing condoms to his audience, as well as clothing predominantly out of S&amp;M culture, Until December were a blip on the indie music scene releasing this, their self titled, and only album.  They signed to the indie label 415 Records in San Francisco after putting forth their industrial disco and doom metal mix on stage.  They have a cult following even now in the homosexual community and DJs in Canada and the US have this LP in their collection as the groove of the record can&amp;#039;t be denied.  Never released onto CD, this album, and band,  are all but forgotten. \n\n\n\n01 No Gift Refused 4:21 \n02 Heaven 4:21 \n03 Sequence Line 3:48 \n04 Mirrors 3:49 \n05 Call Me 3:34 \n06 Forgive and Still Forget 4:25 \n07 Free Again 4:48 \n08 Zodiac Drum Solo 1:15 \n09 Slave 4:54 \n10 Geisha 6:21 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:763ac5e59c192ba597c6502f53041ed6a06046c6","amp;dn":"Until+December+-+S%2FT+%5B1986%5D+Re-seed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"763ac5e59c192ba597c6502f53041ed6a06046c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,58,197,229,156,25,43,165,151,198,80,47,83,4,30,214,160,96,70,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
