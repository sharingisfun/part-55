They investigate the GuantÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡namo Bay detention facility (GITMO) used by the United States in housing enemy non-combatants for purposes of interrogation to seek intelligence that can be used in the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT).\n\nIt is clear that the filmmakers do not like the facility; they raise issues regarding application of the Geneva Conventions, and also propose there is a linkage between tough practices for interrogation developed at GITMO and the disaster at Abu Gareb in Iraq.\n\nThe documentary, however, does present alternative views, and on the whole this work is balanced and not a piece of propaganda. It raises serious questions regarding the new environment of GWOT, including the role of private contractors and the issues raised by Al Quaeda not being a country, but rather a private organization. In other words, what are the legal and ethical issues that arise when &quot;war&quot; is not between countries, but between countries and private organizations.\n\n_____ Keywords _____\nGuantanamo Bay, Cuba, War on Terror, 911, 9/11, George Bush, Dick Cheney, American Military, Al Quaeda, USA.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0711d5464a03d465111f464eee370508c55d0ed2","amp;dn":"Gitmo-The+New+Rules+Of+War--+Documentary+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0711d5464a03d465111f464eee370508c55d0ed2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,17,213,70,74,3,212,101,17,31,70,78,238,55,5,8,197,93,14,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
