They fed Andy, who played in a\n\ncramped corner by the door (where the drunk chick, who is on the recording, kept\n\naccidentally bashing Andy on the ass even while he played, not even missing a\n\nbeat to the surprise and adulation of the audience!)\n\n\nA fun, noisy restaurant performance... it&amp;#039;s just like being there when you can&amp;#039;t\n\nafford to eat out - something a lot of punk rockers can probably relate to. And\n\nif you live in Melbourne, please get a copy of this show to the kids that run\n\nthat restaurant. They are awesome and rad and stuff. Peace.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b42dba496aa33f1785149c2bc75e0b4a5a385a0","amp;dn":"Andy+Warstar+-+06-18-07+Melbourne%2C+Oz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b42dba496aa33f1785149c2bc75e0b4a5a385a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,66,219,164,150,170,51,241,120,81,73,194,188,117,224,180,165,163,133,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
