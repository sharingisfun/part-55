The main game&amp;#039;s eboot has both discs in one. When you complete disc one, press home then choose change discs and choose disc 2. It&amp;#039;s that simple. The second eboot is the VR missions disc which comes with this re-release. If you plan to have both eboots on the same memory stick at once, you&amp;#039;ll need a 2GB stick or better.\n\nI RECOMMEND USING THE 3.72 PRX&amp;#039;S TO PLAY BOTH THE MAIN GAME AND VR MISSIONS!\n\nEnjoy, and remember if you don&amp;#039;t own this game, buy it! It&amp;#039;s available on import websites and eBay and  is a classic PSX game. This re-release is my favorite version of the game we SHOULD have gotten in America when we got the lame addon VR missions disc only.\n\nRipped by Evil-Eye (AKA Evil-Twin on TPB.org)\n\nThanks goes to:\n\nSonic5688: For packaging all Popstation PRX&amp;#039;s to make this game (And MANY others!) work\n\nRhiffSta: The creator of http://popsdb.twystneko.com/ where I downloaded the themes for both of these games.\n\np1ayer000: For the main game&amp;#039;s PSP theme which is viewable here:\n\nnobbert: For the VR Missions PSP theme.\n\nAlso thanks to all of the real PSP coders like Dark_Alex and Co. for opening doors for ALL OF US!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:873cf269892c258f7d99a948a6ca7d5989f1fdac","amp;dn":"Metal+Gear+Solid+Integral+PSXonPSP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"873cf269892c258f7d99a948a6ca7d5989f1fdac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,60,242,105,137,44,37,143,125,153,169,72,166,202,125,89,137,241,253,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
