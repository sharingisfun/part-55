This is the best live DVD I will ever own. \nEvery so often it all comes together. Band, crowd, venue and the music itself. Always the music. But it each element has its own way to play. Without one the rest is nothing. Alchemy, they sometimes call it. They also sometimes call it a great show.\nWhen Placebo took the stage on october 18th, 2003, before 16000 up-for-it fans, everyone just knew. There was something in the air, along with several thousand arms. The ensuing hour and a half journey through the bands career moved effortlessly from the anthemic euphoria of favourites  Pure Morning, The Bitter End, And Taste In Men to the cathartic drama of tracks such as Peeping Tom and Protege Moi. The Latter managing to archive a poignant, vulnerable intimacy, despite or quite possible because of the vastness of the surroundings. \nBy the time Frank Black (pixies) arrived for the show-stopping finale: Where Is My Mind - Nobody wanted the night to end, least of all, Brian Molko (the leadsinger). Everyone was relieved that the whole thing had been captured on film: A permanent, lasting record - One in which Soulmates Never Die!!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33efb00a39f6af8fd427c6ed39466295d225374b","amp;dn":"Placebo+-+Soulmates+Never+Die%3A+Live+In+Paris+2003","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33efb00a39f6af8fd427c6ed39466295d225374b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,239,176,10,57,246,175,143,212,39,198,237,57,70,98,149,210,37,55,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
