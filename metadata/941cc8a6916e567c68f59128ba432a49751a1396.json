It's the full show, all three hours. \r\n\r\nI captured it via a Linux program, and converted it to MP3 at 64 Kbps. I'm really new at this, so I'm only trying to fill the missing show. I just wanted to make it available, because I rely on others to post it and since this one wasn't there, I decided to upload it myself. I have the original AAC file if anyone asks for it, but that's up to you guys. \r\n\r\nSo please let me know if this helps for the show. \r\n\r\nThanks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:941cc8a6916e567c68f59128ba432a49751a1396","amp;dn":"Midnight+in+the+Desert+with+Art+Bell+-+2015-11-05.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"941cc8a6916e567c68f59128ba432a49751a1396","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,28,200,166,145,110,86,124,104,245,145,40,186,67,42,73,117,26,19,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
