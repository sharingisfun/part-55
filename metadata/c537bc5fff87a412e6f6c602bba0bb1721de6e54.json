Blue: The Blood Gulch Chronicles Season 5 dvd.\n\nUnlike other torrents, this is the real deal here. Its not the low-res movies off their sites, THIS IS THE ACTUAL DVD, WITH ALL BONUS FEATURES INCLUDED\n\nDirections:\n\nUnzip the file\nDelete .DS_Store if its there, you dont need it.\nBurn only the VIDEO_TS and AUDIO_TS to the root(not in any subfolders) of a dvd using windows explorer, apple finder, linux whatever, or your favorite dvd burning program. NOTE: you do need a dual-layer DVD and a capable drive to do this.\n\nThe folder that says do not burn contains hi-res images of the DVD and the dvd case, for lightscribing and labeling purposes.\n\nIf you dont have a burner that can burn dual-layer DVDs, some dvd player applications, like the ones that come with all macs can directly play VIDEO_TS folders.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Please Seed!\n\n\n\nRipped with MacTheRipper v. 2.6.6","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c537bc5fff87a412e6f6c602bba0bb1721de6e54","amp;dn":"Red+vs+Blue+Season+5+DVD+ISO+RvB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c537bc5fff87a412e6f6c602bba0bb1721de6e54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,55,188,95,255,135,164,18,230,246,198,2,187,160,187,23,33,222,110,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
