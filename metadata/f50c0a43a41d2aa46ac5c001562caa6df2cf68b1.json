The first is of particular interest. Dating from 1952, it was a special event, exploiting the then-new LP format to include a dozen of Ellington&amp;#039;s most familiar tunes and featuring a superb band. The young Peterson could generate the swing of a big band, while the similarly virtuosic bassist Ray Brown and guitarist Barney Kessel complement him brilliantly. Together they combine boppish approaches and inspired interplay (and a kinetic energy that you would never expect from a trio without drums) to staples like &quot;In a Mellow Tone,&quot; &quot;Take the &amp;#039;A&amp;#039; Train,&quot; and &quot;Rockin&amp;#039; in Rhythm.&quot; The second half of the CD is a 1959 stereo remake of the original 1952 session, but with drummer Ed Thigpen taking Kessel&amp;#039;s place. Despite the similarity in the material, it&amp;#039;s an utterly different session, typical of the masterful manner that Peterson gradually developed. It&amp;#039;s well-made music, played with consummate polish and ease and clear regard for the material, though without the inventive edges of the earlier group. --Stuart Broomer\n\nOriginal recordings produced by Norman Granz\nTracks 1-12 recorded December 1952, probably at Radio Recorders, Hollywood\nTracks 13-24 recorded between July 14 and August 9, 1959 at Universal Recording Studios, Chicago\n\n\nTrack Listing:\n1.
