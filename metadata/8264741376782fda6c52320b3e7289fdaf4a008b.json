Born into poverty in London&amp;#039;s East End, Caine is now a film star whose Hollywood lifestyle is a long way from his cockney roots. Here, he reveals the truth about his childhood, and his years of struggle to make it in the entertainment business. He talks of his relationships with other actors and directors and the way in which he developed the distinctive stage and screen presence which is now his hallmark. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8264741376782fda6c52320b3e7289fdaf4a008b","amp;dn":"Michael+Caine+-+What%5C%27s+it+all+About%3F+%28autobiography%29+read+by+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8264741376782fda6c52320b3e7289fdaf4a008b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,100,116,19,118,120,47,218,108,82,50,11,62,114,137,253,175,74,0,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
