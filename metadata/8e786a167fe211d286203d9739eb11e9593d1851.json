( a link to the file at TPB would also help if you have an idea ).\n\nThis file is 640x480 at 20 FPS.  I think it looks good and is a balance between quality and size.\n\nDo keep in mind I am limited what quality I can get off my TiVo so there we are.\n\nGive me constructive feedback as you like and I can try to adjust for day 12.\n\nNOW HELP ME SEED PEOPLE! ( you all said you would! )\n\nYour fellow SUMO fan, SciFi-Sumo!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e786a167fe211d286203d9739eb11e9593d1851","amp;dn":"Haru+Basho+2008++Day+11++SUMO+FULL+DAY.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e786a167fe211d286203d9739eb11e9593d1851","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,120,106,22,127,226,17,210,134,32,61,151,57,235,17,233,89,61,24,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
