MP3 format, quality ranges from 64KBPS (what? some new guy at the station probably) to 128KPBS, a few files are even higher as I was forced to get files from secondary sources (new guy didn&amp;#039;t show up for work), 44KHz.  Files are uniformly named with embedded album covers and M3U playlist.\n\nIf you like what you hear, I strongly urge you to join KCRW as a member or donate to the station (KCRW.com or at 89.9 FM in the LA area).  Enjoy!\n\nOther torrents for proceeding months:\nFebruary 2008: http://thepiratebay.se/tor/4142424/\nMarch 2008: http://thepiratebay.se/tor/4110477/\nApril 2008: http://thepiratebay.se/tor/4165579/\n\n0500 Top Tunes May 2008\n\n0501 West Indian Girl - All My Friends [Jason Bentley Remix].mp3\n0502 Bostich &amp; Fussible - Tijuana Sound Machine.mp3\n0505 Kinky - Coqueta [Panoptica Remix].mp3\n0506 Robin Danar Feat.
