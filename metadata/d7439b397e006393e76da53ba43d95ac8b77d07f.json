By the time you finish reading this, 70 new variants of malware will have been released. Are you prepared? With ESET Smart Security, you won&amp;#039;t have to ask.\n \nESET Smart Security is a tightly integrated solution designed to protect computers from a range of threats. Built on the award-winning ESET NOD32Ã‚Â® Antivirus and its powerful ThreatSenseÃ‚Â® engine, ESET Smart Security provides antispyware, antispam and customized firewall features to protect against viruses, trojans, worms, adware, spyware, phishing, rootkits and other Internet threats. Utilizing ThreatSense ? the industry&amp;#039;s most advanced heuristics ? the window of vulnerability between virus outbreak and signature update is reduced.\n\nESS provides:\n*************\n\nProactive Protection: award winning ThreatSense technology combines multiple layers of detection protecting you from Internet threats before it is too late. The included antispam and personal firewall features provide you with a total security solution. Precise Detection: ESET accurately identifies known and unknown threats. It consistently wins top awards from testing labs and is recognized for having zero false positives.1 Lightweight \nDesign: Smart Security requires less memory and CPU power, allowing your computer to run fast, making more room for games, web browsing, and emailing. Fast Scanning Speeds: ESET Smart Security is a highly efficient program ensuring fast file scanning and product updates, while running quietly in the background.\n\n\nServer Installation: ESET Smart Security Business Edition\n\nMay be installed on servers as well as workstations (the Home Edition can only be installed on workstations). This is a critical feature for the competitive business as servers are just as vulnerable to attack as workstations. Should your servers be unprotected, one virus can take down your entire system. Remote Administration Monitor and administer your security solution from anywhere in the world with the ESET Remote Administrator. This is an absolutely necessary feature for the business with more than one location, or the systems administrator who works remotely or travels. ?Mirror? Capability: ESET?s mirror functionality enables your IT administrator to conserve bandwidth by creating a ?mirror? of protected workstations, and pushing updates independently. This prevents each employee from having to access the Internet for updates, which not only conserves resources, but also reduces overall susceptibility to threats\n\n\nSystem Requirements\n*******************\n\nProcessors supported: 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) IntelÃ‚Â®, AMDÃ‚Â® or 100% compatible \nOperating Systems: Windows 2000, XP (32 and 64-bit), VistaÃ‚Â® (32 and 64-bit)\n\nMemory: 35 - 40 MB, on average \n\n18 MB Disk Space \n\n\n-------------------\nThreatSense Update  \nv.2927 (20080306)    \n-------------------\n\n\nInstall:\n\n1) Run setup and you&amp;#039;re finished.
