If I am not mistaken, I have come across this band in the past, but I am not pretty sure. Anyway, the fact is that SADIST just released their brand new album and I am here to review it. Since I searched for some info and confirmed that I was right of the kind of music they play, I can go on with this review, which by the way I have a feeling that it will be more than pleasant.\n\nSADIST is a technical Death Metal band that hails from Genoa, Italy. They were formed back in 1990 and if I am not mistaken, SADIST is the first Italian band that stepped on WackenÃƒÂ¢??s scene. The band went on to a really bad move with their 2000 album &quot;Lego&quot; and they ceased fire for some years. The band is now resurrected and has signed a contract with the Italian Beyond Productions to release one more album full of technical Death Metal madness.\n\nSADISTÃƒÂ¢??s current line up form contains three members of the Italian Death Metal band THE FAMILI (basically it is THE FAMILI with another bass player). Not that this is important, but some people may find it interesting. Anyway, as I previously said, SADIST is a technical Death Metal band with a sound close to bands like SADUS, ATHEIST, CYNIC and QUO VADIS. In &quot;Sadist&quot;, the band unveils its incredible technical knowledge without ending up being boring. The members are all incredible musicians - regarding both technique and compositions - and they prove it in the eleven songs this album contains. The production is great, something that makes the sound heavy and solid, the structure of every songs is beyond any expectation and the variety of sounds this band can use is incredible! SADIST are back for real and they are here to stay! The Death Metal meets Jazz meets Ethnic style is a kind of music a few people can play and even fewer can compose. SADIST belong to the last category and there is no other way to find this out for yourselves than by buying &quot;Sadist&quot;.\n\nJust get this album in your hands and sit down to witness approximately 45 minutes of technical Death Metal madness! If you loved the last SADUS album, then this band released an album that will look beautiful next to &quot;Out For Blood&quot;. Do not hesitate even for a moment. Go get it now!&quot; - http://www.metal-temple.com/review.asp?id=2038\n\nSadist\n\nSadist - (2007)\n\n1. Jagriti\n2. One Thousand Memories\n3. I Feel You Climb\n4. Embracing The Form Of Life\n5.
