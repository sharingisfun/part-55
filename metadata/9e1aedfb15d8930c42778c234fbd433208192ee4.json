It shows off David Couse&amp;#039;s clever wit with cynical digs at melancholy alt-rock. It is also a bit of a big at modern society, but in a fun way. The music is fun, bright pop music, with many textures and tones. The music style is a fusion of an eclectic mix, though the main one is Ringo Starr-style pop. Fave tracks (from the 13-song American release) include &amp;#039;Spinster&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Everything I am&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;She keeps me humble&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Make me proud&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;Here come the good times&amp;#039;. The last song is a refreshing change of pace from the negative nineties, as is a lot of this album (though not all of it).\n\n\n01 Intro  \n02 Here Come the Good Times  \n03 She Keeps Me Humble  \n04 Why Me?  \n05 Make Me Proud  \n06 Everything I Am  \n07 Curious  \n08 These Things  \n09 The Comedy Is Over  \n10 The Strong and the Silent  \n11 Bg Talk  \n12 Deadhead  \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e1aedfb15d8930c42778c234fbd433208192ee4","amp;dn":"A-House+-+Wide+Eyed+And+Ignorant","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e1aedfb15d8930c42778c234fbd433208192ee4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,26,237,251,21,216,147,12,66,119,140,35,79,189,67,50,8,25,46,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
