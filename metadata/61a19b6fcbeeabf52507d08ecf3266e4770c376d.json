Cast almost entirely with newcomers, The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love brings Randy&amp;#039;s family (a lesbian aunt and an assortment of current and past partners), Evie&amp;#039;s well-heeled and overprotective mother (Stephanie Barry), and a collection of friends, enemies, one ex-boyfriend (Andrew Wright), and one unsatisfactory affair (Maggie Moore) into the mix, balancing the excitement and passion of adolescent romance with the pitfalls of social and familial rejection. Maintains a light and quirky tone throughout, reminiscent in many ways of the teen comedies of John Hughes. ~ Genevieve Williams, All Movie Guide\n\nRunning Time: 94 mins \nComplete Cast:\nLaurel Holloman - Randy Dean\nKate Stafford - Rebecca Dean\nMaggie Moore - Wendy\nAndrew Wright - Hayjay\nNelson Rodriguez - Frank\nLillian Kiesler - Old Lady #1\nNicole Ari Parker - Evie\nSabrina Artel - Vicky\nToby Poser - Lena\nStephanie Berry - Evelyn Roy\nMaryette Charlton - Old Lady #2\n\nDirector(s):Maria Maggenti\nWriter(s):Maria Maggenti\nProducer(s):Dolly Hall\nMPAA Rating: R(Adult Situations, Watch With Your Teen, Sexual Situations)\nSubtitles:Eng/Spa\nClosed Caption\nTechnical Details:\nLanguage:Eng\nStudio:New Line Home Video\nGenre:\nRomance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61a19b6fcbeeabf52507d08ecf3266e4770c376d","amp;dn":"The+Incredibly+True+Story+of+Two+Girls+in+Love","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61a19b6fcbeeabf52507d08ecf3266e4770c376d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,161,155,111,203,238,171,245,37,7,208,142,207,50,102,228,119,12,55,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
