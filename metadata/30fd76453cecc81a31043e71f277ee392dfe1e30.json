The &quot;Mamasan trilogy&quot; is performed and explained as follows: &quot;The next three songs ... we&amp;#039;ve never really played them together, but they go together. You wanna hear about it? I never told anybody about this before. I don&amp;#039;t wanna ruin any interpretations of the songs that you have, but it&amp;#039;s about incest and it&amp;#039;s about murder and all those good things. And if you can picture it in your mind, the third song takes place in a jail cell so this is our own little mini-opera here ...&quot; and &amp;#039;Alive&amp;#039; is played. The second song of the trilogy, &amp;#039;Once,&amp;#039; has a lead in: &quot;What you did to me, ain&amp;#039;t right ... problem child ... cuz I ain&amp;#039;t crazy. Once upon a time ...&quot; and Ed screams into a raging &amp;#039;Once.&amp;#039; And just before &quot;Footsteps,&amp;#039; &quot;So this is act three.&quot; &amp;#039;Shower the People&amp;#039; is a James Taylor cover. &amp;#039;Brass in Pocket,&amp;#039; is a Pretenders song with the lyrics revised a bit. (&quot;I&amp;#039;ll kick the fuck outta you ... I don&amp;#039;t give a fuck.&quot;) Ed refers to &amp;#039;Suggestion&amp;#039; as, &quot;... the same song my dad used to sing to me when he beat me.&quot; A great show featuring an excellent version of &amp;#039;Porch.&amp;#039;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.fivehorizons.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.fivehorizons.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30fd76453cecc81a31043e71f277ee392dfe1e30","amp;dn":"Pearl+Jam+-+Zurich%2C+Switzerland+1992","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30fd76453cecc81a31043e71f277ee392dfe1e30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,253,118,69,60,236,200,26,49,4,62,113,242,119,238,57,45,254,30,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
