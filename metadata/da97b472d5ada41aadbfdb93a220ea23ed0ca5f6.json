Severed leg&amp;#039;s, drunk Doctors and and a 1/4 grain all go into making this a superb little tale that every family should gather round come christmas morning.\n\nWith a small scene during Thanksgiving at Burrough&amp;#039;s house tagged on the end (he slices the Turkey with a switchblade) it&amp;#039;s a worthy way of spending 22 mins over and over again.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0125812/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0125812/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da97b472d5ada41aadbfdb93a220ea23ed0ca5f6","amp;dn":"The+Junkie%5C%27s+Christmas+%281993%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da97b472d5ada41aadbfdb93a220ea23ed0ca5f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,151,180,114,213,173,164,26,173,191,219,147,162,32,234,35,237,12,165,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
