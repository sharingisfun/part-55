So, I always like to make a \n                 copy of my movies and play the copy rather than the original.\n                 If something were to happen to the backup, I trash it and \n                 make another back up. After being asked by a good number of \n                 people how to copy DVD?s, I put this little video together. \n                 I received a lot of criticism because I didn?t use all open\n                 source applications. But oh well! The techniques are a little\n                 out of date, but they will still work. Instead of DVD \n                 Decrypter, you may want to use DVDFab Decrypter. This\n                 application is an all-in-one solution. Remember; don?t copy\n                 a movie that you do not own!\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= Video List -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\nVideo 1        : How to Back Up Your DVD&amp;#039;s\n/* ************************************************************************** */\n/* ***************************** About WiBit.Net **************************** */\n/* ************************************************************************** */\nWiBit was a website used by college students (and one professor) from Towson \nUniversity in Baltimore, Maryland as a repository for learning materials. The\nsite creators were former Computer Science and Computer Security students, \nKevin Willett and Bryan Stouffer. The first WiBit Tutorials were created by \nKevin as a study aid for himself in late 2003. Over the following years Kevin\nand Bryan decided to create a few tutorials and give themselves and their\nfellow students a place to view and use them. Some were used as presentation\naids and students teaching students seminars. Over 30 tutorials were created!\nThe WiBit Tutorials served themselves well! All the students involved in the\nproject became professionals in their field of study. The creators Kevin and \nBryan currently develop medical software. Others are working for great \ncompanies such as Bowing and Lockheed Martin. Since college the need to \ncreate tutorials has died down, but who knows what the future holds!\n\nKevin can be reached at: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;f383819c849f9681989790b3949e929a9fdd909c9e&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n/* ************************************************************************** */\n/* *************************** We Hope You Enjoy! *************************** */\n/* ***************** (-: IF YOU LIKE, PLEASE SEEEEED!!! :-) ***************** */\n/* ******************************* It&amp;#039;s Legal ******************************* */\n/* ************************************************************************** */","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9642f462230ca32eb73a28a4dfc043977a069fa","amp;dn":"WiBit.Net+Video+Tutorial+-+How+To+Back+Up+Your+DVD%5C%27s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9642f462230ca32eb73a28a4dfc043977a069fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,100,47,70,34,48,202,50,235,115,162,138,77,252,4,57,119,160,105,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
