HeÃƒÂ¢??s offered a job at Wirral County ÃƒÂ¢?? a team his dad once played for ÃƒÂ¢?? and believes he can resurrect the side, currently languishing as the bottom of their league.\n\nBassett has fallen on hard times since reaching the latter stages of the World Cup. He takes the post as the struggling Ellesmere Port-based side, much to the annoyance of Karine, played once again by Amanda Redman Steve Edge, who will be familiar to viewers thanks to Peter KayÃƒÂ¢??s Phoenix Nights, joins the cast as BassettÃƒÂ¢??s coaching partner Doddsy.\n\nEpisode 1: Football&amp;#039;s Coming Home\nEpisode 2: Going Dutch\nEpisode 3: Flat Pack Four\nEpisode 4: Return Of The Paralytic Son\nEpisode 5: Seven Brothers For Seven Brothers\nEpisode 6: Abide With Me\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNOTE ABOUT SEEDING\nPlease seed after you have downloaded. I will seed however my upstream bandwidth is only 20Kbps (best I can achieve where I live on any provider, until July, when ADSL2+ launches here). Due to my low bandwidth speed for a few days from submitting torrent will likely be slow. Sorry, please allow the torrent to download at its speed. Once the torrent circulates speeds will pick up greatly.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49ac1c2627261dc72e2faf5f9815b34630fbe69d","amp;dn":"Mike+Bassett+Manager+Complete+TV+Series+xVid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49ac1c2627261dc72e2faf5f9815b34630fbe69d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,172,28,38,39,38,29,199,46,47,175,95,152,21,179,70,48,251,230,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
