CARRIER follows a core group of film participants aboard the USS Nimitz, from the admiral of the strike group to the fighter pilots to the youngest sailors, as they navigate personal conflicts around their jobs, families, faith, patriotism, love, the rites of passage and the war on terror.\n\nExecutive Producer: Mel Gibson\n\nEpisode Five: Show of Force\n\nThe mission really kicks off when the Nimitz arrives in the Gulf. The conditions are extreme: flight deck personnel endure temperatures hovering around 120 degrees, while the pilots undertake grueling six-hour missions over Iraq.\n\nRelease Info:\nSource......: W4F and SoS HDTVRips\nLength......: 00:54:59\nVideo.......: XviD 1626kb/s 29.970fps 720x400\nAudio.......: 136kb/s MP3 48000Hz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44284560cdf131faf5708c34623f2f0b6500f14a","amp;dn":"Aviation+-+Carrier+2008+-+5of10+-+Show+Of+Force+-+HDTV+xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44284560cdf131faf5708c34623f2f0b6500f14a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,40,69,96,205,241,49,250,245,112,140,52,98,63,47,11,101,0,241,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
