It should be a great HOH and drama after. If he does go off on Sheila and her side doesn&amp;#039;t win HOH I could see her asking for her DOR for sure.\n\nPart 1 - 22 min\nJosh talks about the vote and how the operation is going, then James calls Sheila out - Sheila/Nat/Chelsia talk. Chelia does her plan of thinking she will vote out Ryan and they are falling for it.\n\nPart 2 - 18 min\nIt&amp;#039;s the Adam show. Adam talks about the game + other stuff? Don&amp;#039;t remember it that well.\n\nPart 3 - 24 min\nHere we go. Josh is steaming and ready to go off on sheila - Sheila talks about Josh and how if he goes off her 3 brothers will kick his ass - Josh fuming some more.\n\nPart 4 - 26 min\nNon-stop drama of Josh. We needed some good drama as the feeds have been slow the past few days.\n\nPart 5 - 20 min\nMore action from all the drama.\n\nPart 6 - 15 min\nJosh goes on a Sheila rant + Nat prays to God for HOH.\n\nPart 7 - 19 min\nSheila/Adam talk.
