July 16, 2003) was a Cuban salsa singer, and was one of the most successful Cuban performers of the 20th century, with twenty-three gold albums to her name and has earned the moniker &quot;La guarachera de Cuba&quot;. She spent most of her career living in New Jersey, and working in the United States and several Latin American countries.\nLeila Cobo of Billboard Magazine once said &quot;Cruz is indisputably the best known and most influential female figure in the history of Cuban music.&quot; Cruz once said in an interview &quot;If I had a chance I wouldn&amp;#039;t have been singing and dancing, I would be a teacher just like my dad wanted me to be&quot;.\n\n\n\n01.
