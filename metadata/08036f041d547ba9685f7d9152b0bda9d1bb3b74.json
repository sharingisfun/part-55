You will have to ensure that they have a constant supply of oxygen, food and water to stay alive.\r\n\r\n You will get them to collect energy, extract water, mine metal, grow food, manufacture bots, and build a fully self-sufficient base.\r\n\r\nEven if the game is not intended to be a simulator, all the mechanics are plausible, and based on what the expected challenges of establishing a colony in an new planet would be.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0.7 released\r\n25 NOVEMBER\r\nThe focus of this version is on gameplay balance improvements: we are adding the new Medical Cabinet component, changing the behavior of Cabins so they are more useful, and tweaking the difficulty of the Frozen and Gas Giant Moon planets. \r\n\r\nNEW CONTENT \r\n- Added Medical Cabinet component to the Sick Bay: Medical Supplies can be stored here to avoid Medics having to go to the nearest storage \r\n- New model for Control Center \r\n\r\nGAMEPLAY CHANGES \r\n- Colonists no longer own beds in the Cabins, now any colonist can sleep in any bed \r\n- Wind is now a bit more stable, it tends to stay away from the extremes, which should make the frozen planet a bit easier \r\n- Increased frequency of Solar Flares in moon planet, which should make it a bit harder \r\n- Increased Monolith cost to 40 Metal and 10 Bioplastic (from 20 and 5), and Prestige to 60 (from 30) \r\n- Reduced Signpost prestige from to 5 (from 10) \r\n\r\nMISC FIXES \r\n- Fixed memory leak \r\n- Preventing the game from overusing the GPU when minimized \r\n- Text highlighting for non English languages works a lot better now \r\n- Guns inside the Armory can now be traded (and Medical Supplies in the Medical Cabinet too). \r\n- New &quot;durable&quot; and &quot;surveyed&quot; status icons \r\n- Improved the appearance of non-Latin text overall \r\n- Fix for resolution settings stuck to 0x0 sometimes \r\n- Better error handing for when the game can't save files \r\n- Many bug fixes\r\n\r\nInstall &amp; Play","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08036f041d547ba9685f7d9152b0bda9d1bb3b74","amp;dn":"Planetbase+1.07++RePack+MonoSoul","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08036f041d547ba9685f7d9152b0bda9d1bb3b74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,3,111,4,29,84,123,169,104,95,125,145,82,176,189,169,209,187,59,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
