His themes are topical, his words hard-hitting, his politics unashamedly radical, but Attila will make you roar with laughter as well as seethe with anger...\n\nInspired by the spirit and &amp;#039;Do It Yourself&amp;#039; ethos of punk rock, and above all by The Clash and their overtly radical, political stance, he started as a punk bass player in 1977 and took the name Attila the Stockbroker in 1980, blagging spots for his poems and songs in between bands at punk gigs. He quickly got a couple of John Peel radio sessions, a deal with London independent record label Cherry Red Records and before very long was on the front cover of Melody Maker...and he hasn&amp;#039;t looked back since! He celebrated the 25th anniversary of his first gig with a sold out show at the Komedia Theatre in Brighton on September 8th 2005.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81f75069f305225664b09b33cec3aca851d641d9","amp;dn":"Atilla+The+Stockbroker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81f75069f305225664b09b33cec3aca851d641d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,247,80,105,243,5,34,86,100,176,155,51,206,195,172,168,81,214,65,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
