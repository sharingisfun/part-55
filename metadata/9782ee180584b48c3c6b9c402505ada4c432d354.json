The set marks the final night of his party KOOL that continued monthly for 12 years at the (again) legendary club, YELLOW, in Tokyo.\n\nKo Kimura (http://www.kokimura.com/) is one of the very first DJs that introduced house music to Japan.  He has been close friends with DJ/producer Satoshi Tomiie (SAW Records, Def Mix Productions) since the beginning era of the genre, as well as producing the dance floor hit \\&quot;Don\\&amp;#039;t Stop\\&quot; with Satoshi under the moniker Level 9.\n\nMuch better known is his talent as a DJ, and he has played sets around the world including Europe, Russia, South America, and various east Asian countries.\n\nKOOL came to a suspension in late May of 2008 as its venue, YELLOW faced a temporary close down due to its location being sold by it previous owner.  It is not know at this time if YELLOW will successfully relocate, and therefore the future of KOOL is also in a limbo.  In order to commemorate what may become the end of a 12 year long party, Ko Kimura decided to extend his set from his usual 6-8 hours to a whopping 13 hour set, which is presented here in its entirety.\n\n\nThe set literally is an epitome of the 12 year history of KOOL.  In it you will hear the most cutting edge progressive house and techno that is Ko\\&amp;#039;s recent style, all the way back to the house, techno and garage tracks from the beginnings of the genre in the late 80s, culminating to a delicious 90s vocal house onslaught in the last hour.  You will hear the best of house music in these 13 hours.\n\n\n\nThe file was given to me directly by Ko, who is my personal friend, with his permission for redistribution via the internet.  To keep the file size manageable, the bitrate is 128kbps, but the quality is more than acceptable.  Unfortunately, the full track list cannot be reproduced (I don\\&amp;#039;t have the time to make it), but you are welcome to compile one and post in the comments ;-)\n\n\nIf many of you are interested in a sample (of, say, 1hr or so) I can create one and upload that as well.\n\n\nI hope you enjoy this as much as I am doing so right now.  Peace.\n\n\nRawheaD\n\n\n\n\nDISCOGS entry: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/artist/Ko+Kimura&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/artist/Ko+Kimura&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9782ee180584b48c3c6b9c402505ada4c432d354","amp;dn":"Ko+Kimura%2C+KOOL+Final+%40+YELLOW%2C+Tokyo%2C+30+May+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9782ee180584b48c3c6b9c402505ada4c432d354","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,130,238,24,5,132,180,140,60,107,156,64,37,5,173,164,196,50,211,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
