Due to contract\n   issues with Geffen Records, Willard was not supposed to do recording on the\n   album and later decided to leave the band and continue his duties in Angels\n   &amp; Airwaves full time whilst Face to Face drummer Pete Parada joined the band\n   just in time for the tour.\n\n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n  01.
