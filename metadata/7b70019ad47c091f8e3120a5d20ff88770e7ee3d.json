It means never giving up in the search for the truth. Justice is Detective Jack Kempson&amp;#039;s creed. After blowing the whistle on his mates, Kempson is sent to the police department archives to rot - there he tracks down the perpetrators of long unsolved crimes. \n\nOld police cases never die, they just get filed away to a place buried deep within the bowels of Police Headquarters. This is where Detective Jack Kempson (Colin Friels) has been sent after blowing the whistle on his colleagues. For anyone else this would be a death sentence. For Jack, it&amp;#039;s an opportunityÃƒÂ¢??a chance to bring old cases back to life, and bring to trial a whole lot of people who thought they got away with it. To pull this off without support from colleagues requires cunning, humour, some useful alliances and the ability to tap into resources not normally used in your standard police investigation. And that is exactly how Jack likes it. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b70019ad47c091f8e3120a5d20ff88770e7ee3d","amp;dn":"BlackJack+-+All+Episodes+%28Great+Crime+Drama%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b70019ad47c091f8e3120a5d20ff88770e7ee3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,112,1,154,212,124,9,31,142,49,32,165,210,15,248,135,112,231,238,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
