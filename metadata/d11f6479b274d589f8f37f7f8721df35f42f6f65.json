They released one album, which blended the sounds of pop, New Wave, dance music, R&amp;B, and funk.\n\nPrince named the group Vanity 6 (the number representing the group&amp;#039;s breast count). He provided the group, now dressed in lingerie and high heels, with provocative songs (although within the album credits, group members were sometimes given sole writing credits). Their first single, &quot;He&amp;#039;s so Dull&quot; did not do much on the charts, but did appear in the film National Lampoon&amp;#039;s Vacation.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d11f6479b274d589f8f37f7f8721df35f42f6f65","amp;dn":"Vanity+6+-+Drive+Me+Wild","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d11f6479b274d589f8f37f7f8721df35f42f6f65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,31,100,121,178,116,213,137,248,243,127,127,135,33,223,53,244,47,111,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
