Not much is known about it since the production is still up in the air.  \n\nAfter they crash-land on an artificial ring-world called &quot;Halo&quot;, a navy captain, his surviving marines, and a chemically-and-surgically-enhanced supersoldier named John-117 &quot;Master Chief&quot; must find out what the Covenant, the genocidal alien race they are at war with, are looking for on the ring.
