Wasting time, lives and resources, as it did in the USSR under the Soviet system. It lives in the Department of Education-Teacher\\&amp;#039;s Union complex.\n\n\nDo you pay taxes? &lt;grin&gt;\nDo you have children and can\\&amp;#039;t pay them a private school or can\\&amp;#039;t homeschool them?\n\nThen you must watch this.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nTaken from http://abcnews.go.com/2020/Stossel/story?id=1500338\n\n\nNational graduation rates and achievement scores are flat, while spending on education has increased more than 100 percent since 1971. More money hasn\\&amp;#039;t helped American kids.\n\n..\n\nThe longer kids stay in American schools, the worse they do in international competition. They do worse than kids from poorer countries that spend much less money on education, ranking behind not only Belgium but also Poland, the Czech Republic and South Korea.\n\n..\n\nThis should come as no surprise if you remember that public education in the United States is a government monopoly. Don\\&amp;#039;t like your public school? Tough. The school is terrible? Tough. Your taxes fund that school regardless of whether it\\&amp;#039;s good or bad. That\\&amp;#039;s why government monopolies routinely fail their customers. Union-dominated monopolies are even worse.\n\n..\n\nHere\\&amp;#039;s just one example from New York City: It took years to fire a teacher who sent sexually oriented e-mails to \\&quot;Cutie 101\\&quot; a 16-year-old student. Klein said, \\&quot;He hasn\\&amp;#039;t taught, but we have had to pay him, because that\\&amp;#039;s what\\&amp;#039;s required under the contract.\\&quot;\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e04234060e98d28d57a1803bf9371a3b44b5020","amp;dn":"ABC+20-20+Stupid+in+America+w%2FJohn+Stossel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e04234060e98d28d57a1803bf9371a3b44b5020","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,4,35,64,96,233,141,40,213,122,24,3,191,147,113,163,180,75,80,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
