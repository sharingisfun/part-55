Having injected energy into the U.Ks dwindling Britpop scene alongside bands like Feeder and Muse, they soon became poster boys for the industries newly carved &amp;#039;Britrock&amp;#039; pigeonhole.\n\nFrom the start, the album delivers a very British rock of the &amp;#039;90s sound. With strong influences from the likes of The Wildhearts (guitarist Chris McCormack being Danny McCormack&amp;#039;s brother), Senseless Things (drummer Keith&amp;#039;s old band), AP&amp;S, Cecil and Honeycrack, the band have put together a well-produced, well-written, rock &amp;#039;n&amp;#039; roll triumph of an album. Packed with killer tracks, the four-piece play a mature mixture of pop/punk/rock tracks with meaty riffs and addictive melodies running throughout. Vocalist Pete Vuckovic delivers some gritty vocals that work perfectly with the layered tower of chunky guitars. All in all, the album is a fantastic debut album from the British rockers. Well, well worth getting you hands on.\n\nEnjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d16fd07549ea00561309cbb80c8985c75c6de454","amp;dn":"3+Colours+Red+-+Pure","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d16fd07549ea00561309cbb80c8985c75c6de454","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,111,208,117,73,234,0,86,19,9,203,184,12,137,133,199,92,109,228,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
