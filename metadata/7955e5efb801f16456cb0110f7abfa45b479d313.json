Fans thought he was trying to rap but they couldn&amp;#039;t hear anything. Mike apologized, and called for Jason to make sure that the fans wouldn&amp;#039;t be &quot;cheated of any more music&quot; and all that.\n- Chester messed up in the middle of Valentine&amp;#039;s Day and left out a line, instead saying &quot;Sorry, let me catch up&quot;.\n- Mike&amp;#039;s little sneaky self was nowhere to be seen at the start of the 2nd encore, but appeared in the pit about 50 ft from the stage right before &amp;#039;A Place For My Head&amp;#039; started. The pit was really rowdy during the song, and after it finished, Mike pulled out a can of silly string and sprayed the pit with it. Awesome! \n\nA LPLive.net release.\nThanks to the LPU for the show. Lets hope the other shows are quicke to be uploaded. \nI added the cover art to this torrent for the North American 08 Winter Tour.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7955e5efb801f16456cb0110f7abfa45b479d313","amp;dn":"Linkin+Park+-+2008-02-26+-+Nashville%2C+TN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7955e5efb801f16456cb0110f7abfa45b479d313","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,85,229,239,184,1,241,100,86,203,1,16,247,171,250,69,180,121,211,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
