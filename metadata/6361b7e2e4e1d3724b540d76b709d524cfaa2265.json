The three-piece indie rock band has just released their new album \\&quot;O sinner\\&quot; on the independent record label Cell Records. The album was recorded at David Lowry\\&amp;#039;s (Cracker, Camper Van Beethoven) Sound Of Music Studios in Richmond, VA and was produced and mixed by Brian Paulson (Beck, Wilco, Husker Du, Dinosaur Jr). In January, bloom will be leaving Florida for a national tour playing in support of the Suicide Girls Burlesque Show. The 40 city tour is being routed by The Kork Booking Agency where bloom will be playing at the country\\&amp;#039;s most legendary clubs: Metro (Chicago), Great American Music Hall (San Francisco), Knitting Factory (New York). \\&quot;O sinner \\&quot;, bloom\\&amp;#039;s fourth release, dives further into the bands 80\\&amp;#039;s pop influences presenting material that is expertly simple, imaginative, and anthemic. The band blends the unique dynamics of the Pixies with the cool catchiness of the Jesus and Mary Chain. The album \\&quot;O sinner\\&quot; is a picture book of melancholic pop portraits.\\&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6361b7e2e4e1d3724b540d76b709d524cfaa2265","amp;dn":"bloom.+discorgaphy+%28alternative+band+from+Gainesville%2FOrlando+Fl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6361b7e2e4e1d3724b540d76b709d524cfaa2265","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,97,183,226,228,225,211,114,75,84,13,118,183,9,213,36,207,170,34,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
