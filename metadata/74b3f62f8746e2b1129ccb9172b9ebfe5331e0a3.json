On a warm September evening, college professor Ethan Learner, his wife Grace, and their daughter Emma are attending a recital. Their 10-year-old son Josh is playing cello--beautifully, as usual. His younger sister looks up to him, and his parents are proud of their son. On the way home, they all stop at a gas station on Reservation Road. There, in one terrible instant, he is taken from them forever. On a warm September evening, law associate Dwight Arno and his 11-year-old son Lucas are attending a baseball game. Their favorite team, the Red Sox, is playing--and, hopefully, heading for the World Series. Dwight cherishes his time spent with Lucas. Driving his son back to his ex-wife, Lucas&amp;#039; mother Ruth Wheldon, Dwight heads towards his fateful encounter at Reservation Road. The accident happens so fast that Lucas is all but unaware, while Ethan--the only witness--is all too aware, as a panicked Dwight speeds away. The police are called, and an investigation begins. Haunted by the tragedy, both fathers react in unexpected ways, as do Grace and Emma. As a reckoning looms, the two fathers are forced to make the hardest choices of their lives.  \n\nGenres: Drama, Thriller and Adaptation\n\nRunning Time: 1 hr. 42 min.\n\nRelease Date: October 19th, 2007 (limited)\n\nDVD Release Date: April 8, 2008\n\nMPAA Rating: R for language and some disturbing images.\n\nDistributors: Focus Features\n\nProduction Co.: Archer Street Productions, Random House Films, Nick Wechsler Productions, Miracle Pictures\n\nStudios: Focus Features\n\nFinanciers: Volume One, Twins Financing\n\nU.S. Box Office: $101,440\n\nFilming Locations: Connecticut, USA\n\nProduced in: United States\n\nCast:\nJoaquin Phoenix - Ethan Learner\nMark Ruffalo - Dwight Arno\nJennifer Connelly - Grace Learner\nMira Sorvino - Ruth Wheldon\nElle Fanning - Emma Learner\nEddie Alderson - Lucas Arno\nSean Curley - Josh Learner\nSamuel Ryan Finn - Cello Player\nSusan Powell - Elegant Parent\nCordell Clyde Lochin - Jimmy McBride\nAntoni Corone - Sergeant Burke\nKevin Herbst - Driving Trooper\nGary Kohn - Norris Wheldon\nJohn Slattery - Steve\nNora Ferrari - Nora\nLinda Dano - Grandmother\nJohn Rothman - Minister\nGeisha Otero - Blanca\nBrett Haley - Brett\nSinead Daly - American Girl\nArmin Amero - Rashid\nJohnathan Tchaikovsky - Jock\nLee Goffin-Bonenfant - Student\nAmerick Lewis - African American Student\nDanny Johnson - Investigating Trooper\nBill Camp - Desk Trooper\nStephanie Weyman - Cheryl\nRaum-Aron - Gerry\nDebra Robinson\nMichael Anzalone - Dwight?s Neighbor\nDavid Anzuelo - Raul\nJulian Rebolledo - News Announcer\nPeter Pamela Rose - News Announcer\nKathryn Markey - News Announcer\nRoss Klavan - News Announcer\nSean Oliver - Podcast\nBlanca Camacho - Podcast\nJason Harris - Podcast\n\nReservation Road LIMITED DVDRIP XVID\n\nReleased ......... 20/03/08\nVideo Format .........
