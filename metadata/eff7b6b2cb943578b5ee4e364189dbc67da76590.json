Unattended mode.\n- completely uninstall the ESET NOD32 Antivirus. This is a full Uninstall.\n  Should work even if the MSI uninstaller fails. Can be used to reset the TRIAL\n  TIMER if it has run out.\n- Some Tweaks tasks.\n\n\nThings that you should know:\n\n1 - This tool DON&amp;#039;T DO ANYTHING without your concern. It&amp;#039;s tasks are organized in\n    tabs. They only run when YOU click it. You can run it without executing any task.\n\n2 - This app is a tool for ESET NOD32 Antivirus or ESET SmartSecurity versions 3.x.\n    This package doesn&amp;#039;t include any installer of the products above mentioned.\n    You should download them from wherever you want or use the &quot;Download&quot; task\n    under the &quot;Setup tools&quot; tab.\n\n3 - The install task is automated. It will install ESET NOD32 Antivirus or\n    ESET SmartSecurity and apply the FIX to make it able to download updates.\n    YOU must provide the installer path.\n\n4 - You DON&amp;#039;T NEED to use the &quot;Install&quot; task if you don&amp;#039;t want to. You can install\n    ESET NOD32 Antivirus or ESET SmartSecurity for your own and apply the FIX\n    from the Settings tab.\n--\n\nInfo from the about tab:\n--\nInfo that you don&amp;#039;t need to but may want to know:\n\n- The Trial FIX doesn&amp;#039;t change your ESET NOD32 Antivirus settings neither patches\nany ESET file. The only change made is registry keys related to your product&amp;#039;s\nedition.\n\n- The &quot;Optimal Settings&quot; task applys the ESET NOD32 Antivirus settings that I think\nare the most effective for all systems. This should have the maximum protection and\nmay give you some false positives.\n\n- The Install and Uninstall tasks are designed to work completely unattended but\nthey may confirm actions like restart your computer. The next restart after the\nUninstall task will run a little script to cleanup leftovers. This will happen only once.\n\n- You can backup your current virus signature and restore it later. If you do the\nrestore using this tool, the process is automated. Otherwise, you&amp;#039;ll need to provide\nthe current ESET NOD32 path.\n\n- This tool was tested on Windows XP and Vista. It&amp;#039;s not my fault if it doesn&amp;#039;t work on\nyour system.\n\n- This tool is designed for ESET NOD32 Antivirus 3.x but works also with\nESET Smart Security 3.x.\n\n--\n\nCheck http://www.astatalk.com/viewtopic.php?t=103313 for more info and updates.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eff7b6b2cb943578b5ee4e364189dbc67da76590","amp;dn":"ESET+NOD32+Tools","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eff7b6b2cb943578b5ee4e364189dbc67da76590","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,247,182,178,203,148,53,120,181,238,78,54,65,137,219,198,125,167,101,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
