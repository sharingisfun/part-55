This LP is \nlong OUT-OF-PRINT and was one of my 1st \nattempts at ripping vinyl in 1997.\n\nQuality isn&amp;#039;t great, my family must have \nplayed this LP nearly 10,000 times before\n1980 (!), but it&amp;#039;s now available to any one \nwho is interested, or fondly remembers early \nlate 60&amp;#039;s and early 70&amp;#039;s Mexican Romantica music.\n\nBy 1970, Los Freddy&amp;#039;s had stopped covering \nAmerican hits and began to play strictly \nLatin-penned ballads.\n\nI believe it caused them to be front runner in a \nmusical genre that eventually became called \nROMANTICA. \n\nEnjoy!!\n\nAlso available are the following out-of-print\nLos Freddy&amp;#039;s LP&amp;#039;s:\n\nMato Mi Corazon (1967?)\nObsesion (1968?)\nSin Tu Amor (1969?)\nLagrimas Son (1970?)\nCon Tu Adios (1972)\nQuiero Ser Feliz (1973)\nLlegara Tu Final (1974)\nAquel Amor (1975)\n\nIf you want them...ask.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c695845e9b0e1bf8a70a8cad64bcadf9845b40bb","amp;dn":"Los+Freddy%5C%27s+1970+Lagrimas+Son+%28ECO-969%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c695845e9b0e1bf8a70a8cad64bcadf9845b40bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,149,132,94,155,14,27,248,167,10,140,173,100,188,173,249,132,91,64,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
