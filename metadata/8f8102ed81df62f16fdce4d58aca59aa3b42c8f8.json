For those of you who are too young to remember watching this one, this is one of the best games ever played, with the infamous ?DRIVE? to seal the 4th quarter. Any fan of 80s NFL football will appreciate this. So, I present the 1986 AFC Championship Game between the Denver Broncos and the Cleveland Browns exactly as it appeared on TV in January, 1987. Thanks and props to the person who originally posted this thing on Napster about 8 years ago.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f8102ed81df62f16fdce4d58aca59aa3b42c8f8","amp;dn":"1986+AFC+Championship+Broncos+Vs+Browns+-+THE+DRIVE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f8102ed81df62f16fdce4d58aca59aa3b42c8f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,129,2,237,129,223,98,241,111,220,228,213,138,202,89,170,59,66,200,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
