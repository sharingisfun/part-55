I&amp;#039;m pretty sure the site that I stumbled upon is gone now, because I searched for it so I could provide a link in this description and could not find it.  The site was upfront about it being on DVD-Rs, and that the source were VHS tapes.  So going into it I wasn&amp;#039;t fooling myself into thinking I was getting digitally remastered copies or something.  I figured it would be like watching old VHS tapes.  I could handle paying $60 for old VHS tapes of every episode, why not digital copies?  Well, I got the set a couple days later and found the quality to be somewhat lower than actual old VHS tapes.  Some episodes are unwatchable, but many are actually fairly decent.  So why am I uploading this set?  Well, one reason is that I&amp;#039;ve never seen any episodes of YCDTOTV offered on any torrent site.  Another reason is because maybe someone with better quality copies will see some of these and think, &quot;maybe I should upload my higher quality versions.&quot;  Yet another reason is because maybe that site is still around, charging good people $60 a pop for shitty workmanship. Download it for free here.  Upload it somewhere else.  Spread this around.\n \n\nI&amp;#039;d like to mention that the website www.barthsburgery.com offers quality DVDs of the show, just not of every episode.  Check them out if you have the time.  \n\n\nDISC 1\n1  CJOH Shoestring\n2  Exectuive Washrooms\n3  St. Patrick&amp;#039;s Day\n4  Work\n5  Transportaion\n6  Strike Now\n7  Dating\n8  Fitness\n9  Safety First","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71d7d2201159173307317876adeb8a863ba60677","amp;dn":"YOU+CAN%5C%27T+DO+THAT+ON+TELEVISON+DVD+Disc+1+of+12+%28ISO%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71d7d2201159173307317876adeb8a863ba60677","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,215,210,32,17,89,23,51,7,49,120,118,173,235,138,134,59,166,6,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
