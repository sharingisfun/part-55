They could either follow Radiohead?s lead and use their enormous success and financial security as a springboard to a brave experimental future--or they could play it safe, repeat the tricks used on the 16 million-selling A Rush Of Blood To The Head, and consolidate their position as one of the biggest bands in the world. In truth, despite the Tetris-inspired artwork and presence of teaser track &quot;Talk&quot;--which steals its melody line from electro-futurists Kraftwerk?s gorgeous &quot;Computer Love&quot;--X&amp;Y is more the latter than the former. Fans will be delighted by &quot;What If?&quot;, a piano elegy that takes flight on strings, and slowly builds towards a Beatles&amp;#039; &quot;A Day In The Life&quot;-style climax, while the likes of &quot;Fix You&quot; and hidden track &quot;&amp;#039;Til Kingdom Come&quot;--originally written for country hero Johnny Cash--proves Martin?s skill for simple, affecting songwriting remains intact. One development, however, comes through the judicious inclusion of some rather pleasant synthesiser work--see &quot;White Shadows&quot;, where Martin gently beseeches &quot;Come on love, stay with me&quot; over a gentle Eno-esque keyboard wash","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:373288267ac2c024a1e6313c3c3102ed6d07a6ee","amp;dn":"Coldplay%7EX+%26+Y%28KRG%29gadge007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"373288267ac2c024a1e6313c3c3102ed6d07a6ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,50,136,38,122,194,192,36,161,230,49,60,60,49,2,237,109,7,166,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
