It is about to be rereleased and so I&amp;#039;m not sure if it will be counted in the numbering, but it already was as far as the band was concerned -- #22.\n\nThis album contains:\n\n\nAll the Years\n\nStone of Sisyphus\n\nBigger Than Elvis\n\nSleeping in the Middle of the Bed Again\n\nMah Jong\n\nLet&amp;#039;s Take a Lifetime\n\nThe Pull\n\nHere With Me\n\nPlaid\n\nCry for the Lost\n\nGet On This\n\nThe Show Must Go On\n\n\n\nCHICAGO BELONGS IN THE HALL OF FAME!
