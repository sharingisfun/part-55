These were created using the MediaFace 5 software that is included with the Neato labeling system.\n\nI am not the person who is uploading the 35 DVDs, just a fan how created these labels for his own use and thought others might like them as well. And yes, I know DVDs 34 and 35 are ugly-there&amp;#039;s just a ton of info, you could easily open them up and make them look a bit neater if you didn&amp;#039;t want the listing on the disk.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dce5540eaf00d93b3c3ef96d1f7286dcd36b74af","amp;dn":"MST3K+Neato+Labels","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dce5540eaf00d93b3c3ef96d1f7286dcd36b74af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,229,84,14,175,0,217,59,60,62,249,109,31,114,134,220,211,107,116,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
