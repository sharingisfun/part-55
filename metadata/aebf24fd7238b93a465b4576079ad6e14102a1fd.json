Are you all about capture-capture-capture? Capture-edit-capture-edit? Or a simple capture-send? However you want to do it, SnagIt now plays along. The old, linear workflow is gone. And you can almost taste the freedom.\nCombine images easily\nCombine screen captures with ease with SnagtIt, TechSmith&amp;#039;s Screen Capture Software.\n\nSnagIt makes it easy to combine images. Whether you&amp;#039;re placing last month&amp;#039;s sales chart next to this month&amp;#039;s...or placing funny sunglasses on a photo of your friend. Just drag-and-drop screen captures from the new Open Captures Tray onto the canvas. That&amp;#039;s it!\nSave nothing...save everything\n\nSnagIt now stores every screen capture automatically. Don&amp;#039;t feel any pressure to name the capture or decide where to save it...until you&amp;#039;re ready for that kind of commitment.\nFind your stuff\n\nWhether or not you saved it, find that screen capture later with the new visual search pane. If you can remember even one detail?like the approximate date or the Web site you captured?you&amp;#039;ll find your capture with a click. SnagIt keeps track of these details, so you don&amp;#039;t have to.\nUse the visual search pane to quickly find screen captures in SnagIt, TechSmith&amp;#039;s Screen Capture Software\nGet organized (if you want to)\n\nAs you capture images for next month&amp;#039;s big project, tag them with &quot;big project&quot; or set the &quot;Important&quot; flag. No need to save anything in folders...just come back next month and view all your big project files with a click!\n\nI love the fact that the editor saves and organizes my captures for me. A photo library for my screenshots...what a great idea! ?Stephen Lyle, trainer and project manager, X2 Development Corporation\n\nKeep your tools handy\n\nThe Editor&amp;#039;s new menus make it quicker to get at the features you use most...and easier to discover the ones you&amp;#039;ve never used.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aebf24fd7238b93a465b4576079ad6e14102a1fd","amp;dn":"TechSmith+SnagIt+v.9.0.0+%5BENG%5D+%5BPatch%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aebf24fd7238b93a465b4576079ad6e14102a1fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,191,36,253,114,56,185,58,70,91,69,118,7,154,214,225,65,2,161,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
