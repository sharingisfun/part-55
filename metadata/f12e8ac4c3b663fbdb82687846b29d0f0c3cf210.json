If you\\&amp;#039;re into fun, stylized characters then this tutorial is right for you!. We begin this tutorial by setting up images to assist us in modelling the correct size and proportions of our character.\n\nThe modeling techniques used will be shaping in nurbs, converting to polygons to add details and then into sub\\&amp;#039;ds to define the final shapes. Some of the tools covered in the modelling sections are split polygon tool, cut face tool and sculpt surfaces tool, just to name a few.\n\nOnce the modelling of our new character is complete we move toward preparing our model for texturing. We learn how to lay out and edit UV\\&amp;#039;s for all the different geometry of the body to make it flat so we can get a clean workable UV snapshot for our painted textures. Tools covered in the layout section include planar map, cylindrical map, and automatic map, as well as move and sew UV\\&amp;#039;s. Once the Uv\\&amp;#039;s are finished and you have your snapshot we jump into a paint program add colour and texture to our model.\n\nWe will learn how to use layers for different areas as well as staining up certain parts of the body to get a more realistic look. The last section covers how to texture a few of the nurbs surfaces of our character such as the hair, using Maya built-in shading networks.\n\nYou can see an turntable animation of this character : &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.simplymaya.com/vip_movie_images/red_girl01.avi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.simplymaya.com/vip_movie_images/red_girl01.avi&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f12e8ac4c3b663fbdb82687846b29d0f0c3cf210","amp;dn":"SimplyMaya.com_red_gril_world-gd.com","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f12e8ac4c3b663fbdb82687846b29d0f0c3cf210","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,46,138,196,195,182,99,251,219,130,104,120,70,178,157,15,12,60,242,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
