Showcasing a body of work bookended by 1994&amp;#039;s &quot;Not A Moment Too Soon&quot; and 2006&amp;#039;s &quot;My Old Friend,&quot; it is a reminder of the consistency and depth that have made him such an icon. Several of the songs are drawn from two albums he recorded in a mountaintop retreat with his touring band, 2002&amp;#039;s Tim McGraw &amp; the Dancehall Doctors, and 2004&amp;#039;s Live Like You Were Dying. Together, they sold seven million copies, and between them they produced hits like &quot;Watch The Wind Blow By,&quot; &quot;Red Ragtop,&quot; &quot;She&amp;#039;s My Kind of Rain,&quot; &quot;Real Good Man,&quot; and the ten-week #1, &quot;Live Like You Were Dying,&quot; all of which are included here. The project also includes &quot;Everywhere,&quot; from the CD of the same name, and &quot;Grown Men Don&amp;#039;t Cry&quot; and &quot;The Cowboy In Me,&quot; from 2001&amp;#039;s &quot;Set This Circus Down.&quot;\n\n\nInformation Disc:\n\n?
