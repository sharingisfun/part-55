For the record, DemigodÃ‚Â´s previous album, SHADOW MECHANICS, was released via Spikefarm Records in 2002, so I guess itÃ‚Â´s actually pretty fair to say that it is about the time to get a new album out from these at least semi-legendary Ã‚Â´demi-dudesÃ‚Â´, right dear folks?\n\n\n\nA couple of words of fair warning for starters though. If your only experience with Demigod is restricted to from the bandÃ‚Â´s demo days to their massive Death Metal cult album SLUMBER OF SULLEN EYES, then stop right there, hold your breath, sit down comfortably and have a cold Ã‚Â´nÃ‚Â´ tasty Karhu beer for yourself. Then relax...and listen a minute. For the bandÃ‚Â´s SLUMBER and post-SLUMBER era fans, it should be told to all of you that LET CHAOS PREVAIL introduces Demigod as a whole different sounding band from the one that you may remember from the days of SLUMBER (and further back in the past). In fact, DemigodÃ‚Â´s predecessor SHADOW MECHANICS already spoke clearly about whatÃ‚Â´s to come from the Demigod camp musically. There were already all the signs on SHADOW MECHANICS painted with deep colors into the horizon that DemigodÃ‚Â´s Death Metal era could rightfully be talked about in the past tense - and LET CHAOS PREVAIL, DemigodÃ‚Â´s newest 10-song effort, proves that fact even stronger and clearer. However, I also have to say that I donÃ‚Â´t feel much sorrow for the bandÃ‚Â´s magnificent Death Metal years: they are gone - just like DemigodÃ‚Â´s two very influential song writers, Esa LindÃƒÂ©n and Seppo Taatila, too. I do adore everything they did in the past - and yes, SLUMBER OF SULLEN EYES is still one of the most impressive Death Metal albums ever made in my books of glory and admiration. But that era of Demigod has come to its end a long time ago already, so weÃ‚Â´d better start to live with that and start looking a bit further to a new horizon to what these fellows can actually still offer to us in 2007. Sounds like fair game, doesnÃ‚Â´t it?\n\n\n\nThe album is started off with a heavily riff-driven ?Not Dead Enough? that showcases DemigodÃ‚Â´s extraordinary sense for some really killer, unusual, hypnotic riff-fests. I know this ainÃ‚Â´t the first time from me to say, but Demigod has a thing or two in common with the now defunct Canadian tech-thrashers Obliveon musically - and ?Not Dead Enough? proves it quite clearly. After the kick-ass opener, the albumÃ‚Â´s title track ?Let Chaos Prevail? is let in, Demigod pushes determinedly forward, just adding a bit more tempo and heaviness - allowing &quot;Let Chaos Prevail&quot; to strike ruthlessly with its own heaviness against its listenerÃ‚Â´s face. Also, pay attention to TuomasÃ‚Â´ vocal parts, they are truly powerful, and in fact he has never sounded better. TuomasÃ‚Â´ use of his voice somewhere in between death grunts and more thrash style of vocalism, and his dark and angry vocals fit to DemigodÃ‚Â´s songs perfectly.\n\n\n\n?Dark Turns Black? comes up next - and if you thought this legendary furious Finnish bunch was about to calm down for a moment, youÃ‚Â´re wrong. The tempo has dropped a bit, but at the same time, a fair dose of heaviness has been thrown in. In ?Dark Turns Black? some of DemigodÃ‚Â´s well-known, trademark-ish guitar melodies penetrates through the surface of the song structure and overall the song represents one of the heaviest songs that they have written since the beginning of 2005.\n\n\n\n?Cult of Sickness? sees Demigod breaking again some barricades with their fast, up-tempo riffs Ã‚Â´til the middle part of the songs breaks in with its somewhat familiar ObliveonÃ‚Â´ish vibes. Yet again, some truly excellent riffs dominate this song from start to end, leaving overall a good aftertaste in the listenerÃ‚Â´s mind. ?Cult of Sickness? serves as a sort of counterbalance to the next song, titled ?God Said Suffer?, which turns out to be probably the most eerie and creepiest sounding tune on LET CHAOS PREVAIL. ThereÃ‚Â´s actually not that much happening in this song, but to make a song stand out by its own simple ingredients, it definitely demands some inborn sense to catch all those necessary and vital elements for the song to work. And thatÃ‚Â´s exactly what ?God Said Suffer? does indeed. Another brilliantly composed song from Demigod - just no more, no less.\n\n\n\n?To See the Last One Die? insists that the listener turn up the volume to a maximum level due to an incredible riff-fest the song holds inside. A song itself is kind of like the calm before the actual storm - and when this particular song bursts into a full-scale all-annihilating metallic storm, Demigod doesnÃ‚Â´t stop Ã‚Â´til they see the last one die... you.\n\n?Self-caged? introduces some intriguing Demigod elements again - those being strong and eerie melody lines that have become one of their true trademarks over the years. The song is kinda simple structurally, and partly lacks the same effective punch that most of their songs normally have. However, ?Self-caged? is no filler by any means though.\n\n\n\nItÃ‚Â´s in ?End of Evolution? where the guys return to their path where they can shred a bit more again and show as proof to everyone that they aren?t going to milk their legacy of their awe-inspiring debut album, SLUMBER OF SULLEN EYES. And right after they have thrown in the last two numbers off LET CHAOS PREVAIL, ?The Uncrowned? and ?Baptized in Enmity?, itÃ‚Â´s proven Demigod has neither dropped the ball nor even ever lost it (if some of you have these kinds of vile thoughts in your mind) as far as their outstanding song writing capability is concerned. In 2007 Demigod definitely knows how to deliver...big time!\n\n\n\nLET CHAOS PREVAIL is a fully enjoyable and highly dynamic Demigod album. It doesnÃ‚Â´t pale in comparison to anything they have done before if you just remember to keep in your mind itÃ‚Â´s a long way they have struggled from the days of SLUMBER all the way up to their 3rd album. Therefore letÃ‚Â´s take our hats off for Demigod for this achievement of true strength and survival, ok?&quot; - Metal-Rules.com\n\n\nDemigod\n\nLet Chaos Prevail - (2007)\n\n1. Not Dead Enough\n2.
