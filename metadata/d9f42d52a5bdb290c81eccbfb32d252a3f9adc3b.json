In fact, it's only prudent to prepare\nfor the worst that life has to offer: thus, life insurance, home\ninsurance, extra batteries, security systems, dead bolts, a little\nfire extinguisher in the kitchen, and on and on. However, there's\none glaring omission in most people's planning, one gap in their\nvigilance which is potentially more devastating than if they went\nthrough life smoking in bed, shampooing with gasoline, and taking\nout-of-date aspirin.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9f42d52a5bdb290c81eccbfb32d252a3f9adc3b","amp;dn":"HOW+TO+BE+INVISIBLE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9f42d52a5bdb290c81eccbfb32d252a3f9adc3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,244,45,82,165,189,178,144,200,30,204,191,179,45,37,42,63,154,220,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
