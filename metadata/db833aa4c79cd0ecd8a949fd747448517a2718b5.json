There\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s no spoken dialogue so language and texted languages don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;t really apply except for the opening credits. I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;ve got some other Sokurov I will upload in time and other films as well, including Yasujiro Ozu, Seijun Suzuki, Kenji Fukasaku, a Jan Nemec, Mikio Naruse, Pier Paulo Pasolini, and others once I search through my movie files. Let me know if you guys are interested in any of these. ONly catch is that they will all have eng hardsubs.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nAlmost too ephemeral to be mentioned, A SoldierÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½s Dream, at twelve minutes, is the filmic equivalent of a meager sliver of chocolate, or a haiku, and is actually just a fragment in one of SokurovÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½s more ambitious projects, the five-part, seven-hour Spritual Voices (1995).
