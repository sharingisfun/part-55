Filmed on location in Italy, EMPIRE begins with Julius Caesar&amp;#039;s assassination, and the passing of his power to his nephew Octavius. At only 18 years old, Octavius plunges head-on into a fierce fight for his place as Rome&amp;#039;s rightful leader. Unrated and extended scenes add to the epic drama of ancient Rome.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:776c886c6cb66de8b1e48cf0cf496e36b0e18feb","amp;dn":"Empire%28ENG%29PAKG-dvdrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"776c886c6cb66de8b1e48cf0cf496e36b0e18feb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,108,136,108,108,182,109,232,177,228,140,240,207,73,110,54,176,225,143,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
