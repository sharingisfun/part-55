Sappho\nTodd Soley ... Phil\nLyudmila Shiryaeva ... Helene\nBogdan Stupka ... Professor Orlov\n\nSet in 1926, the movie is saturated with the glamour of the Roaring Twenties. The stock markets booming, newly liberated women have the vote, luxurious ocean liners are crossing the Atlantic, and aeroplanes, automobiles, radios, and telephones are transforming the world. Drawn by the cachet of Europe and pushed by Prohibition in the United States, the young Americans of the Lost Generation are flocking to Paris and other points in the old world. Its the era of jazz, modernism, the Charleston, and flappers in daring clothing. Its the period when the contemporary world is starting to develop. Its against this backdrop that a young American couple, Phil and the interestingly-named Sappho, arrive on the Greek island of Lesbos for a honeymoon.\n\nDVDRip\nSource: PAL DVD9\nRun Time: 01:28:16\nSize: 1.95 GB\nVideo: 704x368 @ 2713 Kbps\nAspect Ratio: 1.91 : 1\nFrame Rate: 25.000 fps (PAL)\nAudio: English AC3 5.1 ch @ 448 Kbps\nSubtitles: n/a\n\nby SHARE|NET.UA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8564d2e769be2ea334f2f796f5fae8f13974ae29","amp;dn":"Sappho+%282008%29+ENG+AC3+XviD+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8564d2e769be2ea334f2f796f5fae8f13974ae29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,100,210,231,105,190,46,163,52,242,247,150,245,250,232,241,57,116,174,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
