By the end of the 1980s, singer Doro Pesch was the sole original member who remained in the band, and thus proceeded to form Doro, a band which was essentially a continuation of Warlock under a different name. The band Doro has several classic songs from Warlock on its repertoire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:925923d326ab7868d75e4bb6027a11afdc39a6e4","amp;dn":"Warlock+-+Fight+For+Rock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"925923d326ab7868d75e4bb6027a11afdc39a6e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,89,35,211,38,171,120,104,215,94,75,182,2,122,17,175,220,57,166,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
