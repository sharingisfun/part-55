Rolling, voluptuous basslines, uptight guitars, and vibrant brass sections drive tracks like the Gap Band&amp;#039;s &quot;You Dropped a Bomb on Me,&quot; the Emotions&amp;#039; &quot;Best of My Love,&quot; and Cheryl Lynn&amp;#039;s &quot;Got to Be Real,&quot; bridging the gap between funk and disco and providing countless rap and hip-hop artists with ample sampling material. Heatwave&amp;#039;s &quot;Groove Line,&quot; Natalie Cole&amp;#039;s &quot;Be Thankful,&quot; GQ&amp;#039;s &quot;Disco Nights (Rock Freak),&quot; and the Dazz Band&amp;#039;s &quot;Joystick&quot; are among the other highlights of this funky, stylish compilation, which documents just how integral these songs were to hip-hop&amp;#039;s development.
