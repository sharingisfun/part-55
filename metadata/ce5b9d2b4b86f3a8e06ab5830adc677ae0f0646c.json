But this torrent is much smaller and much simpler than the other.\n\nHud is a classic with Paul Newman and Patricia Neal. An engrossing story with believable characters. No fairy tale ending, but the ending will leave you thoughful.\n\nIMDB:\nHud Bannon is a ruthless young man who tarnishes everything and everyone he touches. Hud represents the perfect embodiment of alienated youth, out for kicks with no regard for the consequences. There is bitter conflict between the callous Hud and his stern and highly principled father, Homer. Hud&amp;#039;s nephew Lon admires Hud&amp;#039;s cheating ways, though he soon becomes aware of Hud&amp;#039;s reckless amorality to bear him anymore. In the world of the takers and the taken, Hud is a winner. He&amp;#039;s a cheat, but, he explains &quot;I always say the law was meant to be interpreted in a lenient manner.&quot; Written by alfiehitchie \n\n\nBlack and white, full screen, english only, no subs, dvd rip, excellent quality.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0057163/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0057163/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce5b9d2b4b86f3a8e06ab5830adc677ae0f0646c","amp;dn":"Hud+%281963+Paul+Newman%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce5b9d2b4b86f3a8e06ab5830adc677ae0f0646c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,91,157,43,75,134,243,168,224,106,181,131,10,220,103,122,224,240,100,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
