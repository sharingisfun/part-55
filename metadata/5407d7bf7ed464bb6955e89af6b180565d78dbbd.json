But Lyra&amp;#039;s greatest adventure    \n would begin closer to home, the day she heard hushed talk of an              \n extraordinary particle. Microscopic in size, the magical dust- found only    \n in the vast Artic expanse of the North -was rumored to possess profound      \n properties that could unite whole universes. But there were those who        \n feared the particle and would stop at nothing to destroy it. Catapulted      \n into the heart of a terrible struggle, Lyra was forced to seek aid from      \n clans, gyptians, and formidable armored bears. And as she journeyed into     \n unbelievable danger, she had not the faintest clue that she alone was        \n destined to win, or to lose, this more-than-mortal battle...                 \n                                                                              \n\n\n                           Happy Hacker Industries                            \nThis movie should play fine on most DVD/DivX Certified settop\ndvd players.
