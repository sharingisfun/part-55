Adelaide to be exact and their debut reflects their youth in that it lacks a little direction. Asphyxia is obviously a Death Metal band but there are moments of Thrash and Modern Metal thrown into the mix which makes for a somewhat unbalanced album.\n\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢??SilvertongueÃƒÂ¢?? and ÃƒÂ¢??Horrific ReignÃƒÂ¢?? work well and it is clear that itÃƒÂ¢??s Death Metal where the bands heart lies, sort of like a hybrid of Cannibal Corpse and Malevolent Creation in some ways. They sound less confident on cuts such as ÃƒÂ¢??The Hooded FigureÃƒÂ¢?? and ÃƒÂ¢??MartyrÃƒÂ¢?? where Asphyxia goes for a varied vibe by mixing up the arrangements and adding some light and shade. A little diversity certainly never hurt anybody but it doesnÃƒÂ¢??t suit every band and Asphyxia sound more sure of themselves when they go for a more brutal approach.\n\n\n\nAsphyxia can certainly play and are a very talented young act in everyway. Much like the new generation of players they fall into the trap of mixing up way too many styles and their sound often suffers because of it. You do get the rare exception but it usually doesnÃƒÂ¢??t really work in the world of Death Metal. With that said, there is a lot of potential here so I hope that Asphyxia hone in their sound and live up to their name.&quot;\n\n\nAsphyxia\n\nAsphyxia - (2008)\n\n1. Intro\n2. Silvertongue\n3.
