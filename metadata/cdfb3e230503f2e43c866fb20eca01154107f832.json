In 1978, Roger Waters sat down and began writing and recording what would become one of Pink Floyd&amp;#039;s most iconic albums of all time, &quot;The Wall&quot;. The songs on this complete demo collection were allegedly recorded on a 4-Track recorder. Most guitar, bass, drum and vocal parts were recorded by Waters, with the occasional collaboration of David Gilmour.\n\nAgain, this is ACTUALLY real. A co-worker of mine found it in the form of a burned CD being sold at a second-hand record store. The sound quality is so-so even though it&amp;#039;s encoded at 320kbps. It WAS recorded on home equipment, after all.\n\nTRACK LIST:\n\nDISC ONE:\n\n1.  In the Flesh\n2.  The Thin Ice\n3.  Another Brick in the Wall (Part 1)\n4.  The Happiest Days of Our Lives\n5.
