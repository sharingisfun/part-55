WinRAR is a powerful compression tool with many integrated additional functions to help you organize your compressed archives.\r\n\r\nIt can backup your data and reduce size of email attachments, decompress RAR, ZIP and other files downloaded from Internet and create new archives in RAR and ZIP file format.\r\n\r\nWinRAR puts you ahead of the crowd when it comes to compression. By consistently creating smaller archives, WinRAR is often faster than the competition. This will save you disc space, transmission costs AND valuable working time as well. WinRAR is ideal for multimedia files. WinRAR automatically recognizes and selects the best compression method. The special compression algorithm compresses multimedia files, executables and object libraries.\r\n\r\nHomepage http://www.rarlab.com/\r\nChangelog http://www.rarlab.com/rarnew.htm","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40ef2d958f9950bbdae1c8513500b4cfa7d85773","amp;dn":"WinRAR+5.30+Final+Local+Install+%2B+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40ef2d958f9950bbdae1c8513500b4cfa7d85773","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,239,45,149,143,153,80,187,218,225,200,81,53,0,180,207,167,216,87,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
