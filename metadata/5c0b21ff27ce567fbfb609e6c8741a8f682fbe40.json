Depicting all manner of tragic misfits from teenage witches (&quot;Teenage Witch&quot;) to the desperately lonely (&quot;Friendly Ghost&quot;), Souljacker should be a depressing listen. But after the fantastically ramshackle soundtrack of dirty guitars, cosy strings and ambling break beats, E&amp;#039;s greatest gift is the ability to spike the saddest tale with a twisted turn of phrase. Be it &quot;World Of Shit&quot;&amp;#039;s backhanded compliment: &quot;In this world of shit / baby you are it&quot;, the desperate &quot;Mum won&amp;#039;t shave me / Jesus can&amp;#039;t save me&quot; of &quot;Dog Faced Boy&quot; or his retort to his girlfriend&amp;#039;s mocking of his manhood &quot;You say a lot of funny things my little bunny / and I almost always laugh / but that&amp;#039;s not really funny&quot; the darkest tales are his most amusing. A lo-fi masterpiece, with plenty to laugh and cry about, Souljacker confirms E as the undisputed king of geek-dom and a bona fide musical genius.\n\nThe much anticipated follow-up to 2000&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;Daisies Of The Galaxy&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Souljacker&amp;#039; showcases a more aggressive sound, replete with dirty guitars, cosy strings and ambling breakbeats, whilst retaining E&amp;#039;s innate melodic touch and eccentric lyricism. A lo-fi masterpiece, &amp;#039;Souljacker&amp;#039; is another beguiling, eccentric and totally memorable musical journey that begs your indulgence. Includes the single &amp;#039;Souljacker Pt1&amp;#039;.\n\nRolling Stone (3/28/02, p.70) - 3.5 stars out of 5 - &quot;...A hard-looking, no-holds-barred look at the moral bankruptcy of society at large....Over squalling guitars, fuzzy surf lines, loping break beats and lush strings, E spins tales of small-town misfits searching for meaning in a media-driven world...&quot;\n\nEntertainment Weekly (3/22/02, p.110) - &quot;...Artfully skewed...the darkness is strangely joyous...&quot; - Rating: B+\n\nAlternative Press (4/02, p.72) - 8 out of 10 - &quot;...Frontman E lightens his subject matter-but not his touch....You get surly rock jams glorifying social outcasts. You get lo-fi beats underlaid with sublime orchestration....SOULJACKER is fresh, funny and unpredictable...&quot;\n\nCMJ (3/11/02, p.4) - &quot;...E shows his fondness for mutating several styles at once...part caustic blues, part cabaret song and a dash of chaos....It&amp;#039;d be fitting as a centerpiece for a David Lynch film just before normalcy gets up-ended and things go down a surreal, strobe-lit path to psychosis...&quot; \n\nEnjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c0b21ff27ce567fbfb609e6c8741a8f682fbe40","amp;dn":"Eels+-+Souljacker++%5B2+Disc%5D+%5BBonus+Disc%2C+E.P+Rotten+World+Blues%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c0b21ff27ce567fbfb609e6c8741a8f682fbe40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,11,33,255,39,206,86,127,191,182,9,230,200,116,26,143,104,47,190,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
