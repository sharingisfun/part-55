Dr. Walther J. Veight gives four lectures on the origin of the species and tells the real history of the world. Really quite amazing.\nDr. Veight lets you into the secrets people like National Geographic wants to hide from public, and he is an excellent teacher.\n\nDidn't you ever wonder why species can't interbreed with each other if they all came from the same organism in the first place? That's because there's a hidden code in DNA that prevents it. And that's cutting edge modern science talking.\nOr why archaeologists never have found any cross-species like for instance a snake-bird?\n\nHave you noticed how Darwin's theory of the origin of the species, a.k.a. evolution now is being taught and referred to as obvious truth, even though Mr. Darwin himself referred to it as only a theory, and later admitted that he thought the theory had to be wrong? Now check out the evidence Dr. Veith presents..\n\n(Slight digression: And have you noticed how the word &quot;Conspiracy&quot; are constantly linked with the word &quot;theory&quot;, even though so many of the conspirators, from Rockefeller to Rothschild to Kissinger to Adolf Hitler to Andrew Pike's letter to Mazzini on how to make a &quot;New World Order&quot; come about, and the list goes on and on, they have all spoken out, one after the other, so freely about the plan and how they are gonna make it come true. And we're seeing it being done right before our eyes. And yet it's not beyond reasonable doubt? Still it's only a &quot;Conspiracy-Theory&quot;? Strange indeed..)\n\nBut back to the point of this upload:\nIf you after watching these lessons still believe that Darwin was onto something when he came up with his theory, then you probably also believe that the World Trade Center was brought down by two passenger jets crashing into them, and that you can just close your eyes and it'll all go away.. ..and that Jesus is dead.. But He isn't. And He loves you. And that's a fact.. :-)\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;5127342338373823343c30383d11363c30383d7f323e3c&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f98f32ea4e6b272d2acaef6ecf5f7fedacf7e48","amp;dn":"Amazing+Discoveries+Creation+Series+-+Seminar+%28XviD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f98f32ea4e6b272d2acaef6ecf5f7fedacf7e48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,152,243,46,164,230,178,114,210,172,174,246,236,245,247,254,218,207,126,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
