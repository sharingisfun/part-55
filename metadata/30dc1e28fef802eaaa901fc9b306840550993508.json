The \n\nPapal-loyal Islamic Fethullah Gulen is fully exposed, Illuminati Sex Magic(k) rituals \n\nare revealed &amp; details regarding the highest &amp; most secret 100Ã‚Â° of Memphis-Misraim \n\nFreemasonry are uncovered.\n\nThe Superieur Inconnu (Unknown Superiors) &amp; Beati Paoli are discussed regarding their \n\nplaces in the Secret Society Network.\n\nI will make this interview available soon in shorter topic-based sections for easier \n\nlistening &amp; to make particular information easier to access for researching. This is \n\na real builder &amp; some rare &amp; valuable information gets presented, increasingly in the \n\nlatter half &amp; particularly towards the end.\n\nINTERVIEWER?S STATEMENT TO FELLOW RESEARCHERS &amp; LISTENERS:\n\nIn this impromptu interview Leo was recorded in the context of a fairly relaxed, \n\nnon-live-on-air environment, resulting in his speaking as candidly as possible, which \n\nwill hopefully provide a lot more information on which to base conclusions. Hopefully \n\nmore recordings will be possible &amp; made available. I feel that it is better to \n\nmaintain an openness of communications with Leo, one way or the other.\n\nMy only motivation for recording this interview is to have as much information as \n\npossible on which to form my own understanding of what?s going on &amp; to allow for \n\nothers to be in a position to form theirs. It is not to subvert, infiltrate or \n\npropagandise. I have no radio ratings or listenership to worry about, no funding or \n\nany other related matters that are of concern in this regards.\n\nI?ll also take this opportunity to state that even though we discuss matters of his \n\npersonal belief &amp; understanding that aren?t my own, I wanted Leo to be able to make \n\nstatements that were as clear as possible on these matters.\n\nIn truth &amp; awareness -\n\nTroy -\n&quot;\n\n2-303-mins/\n\n\nAbout Leo Lyon Zagami:\n\n&quot;\nZagami, as of April 2008, states that he is now the leader of a breakaway faction of \n\nKnights Templar &amp; high-level Freemasons centred around the elite of the Monte Carlo \n\nLodge.\n\nThis Monaco-based Illuminati Lodge has three levels: the level comprised of the elite \n\nof the esoteric elite is the Ordo Illuminatorum Universalis. This oversees the \n\nMasonic Executive Committee, which in turn oversees the P2 (Propaganda Due) Lodge &amp; \n\nUniversal Unity.\n\nLeo Zagami states that at present he has onside certain Masonic &amp; Templar factions \n\nwith him, in Europe &amp; the U.S.A. The Rome-based Vatican/Jesuits/Knights of Malta \n\nnexus/cabal are, according to Leo, their declared enemies, as are the Satanic \n\nelements within the occult network, including the high-level occultists of the \n\nvarious Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) and Gnostic Catholic Church factions.\n\nHe has also stated that the U.K. based Templar factions are not onside with his \n\nanti-Vatican Templar Esoteric Christian agenda yet, nor is the Skull and Bones of \n\nYale University.\n\nIt is not the intention of this researcher to endorse or refute the statements made \n\nby Leo regarding his present and future intentions in this blog. Let the material \n\npresented stand or fall on its own merits.\n\nOne matter that I will make a clear statement on, is that after much research based \n\nupon studying Zagami?s revelations &amp; following further communication with him, it is \n\nmy firm conclusion that in no way is he a fantasist regarding his having an \n\nIlluminati bloodline background &amp; has more knowledge on the true inner workings of \n\nthe many different aspects of the Illuminati than any ?researcher? out there is \n\ncapable of.\n\nI will post and reply to any constructive comments, whether positive or negative, as \n\ntime permits. In no way do I speak on Leo Zagami?s behalf. Leo is of course welcome \n\nto post comments.\n\nFor more research on the true inner workings of the Illuminati &amp; the New World Order, \n\nincluding aspects which may or may not be at odds with each other, see my main blog:\n\n&quot;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.leozagami.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.leozagami.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n----------------------------------\nTech specs:\n\nMPEG-1 layer 3 (mp3)\n46kbit (VBR)\n44100Hz Joint Stereo\n303:51 (5h3m)\n\n===============================================================================\nOur leaders lie, cheat, steal and kill with virtual impunity.
