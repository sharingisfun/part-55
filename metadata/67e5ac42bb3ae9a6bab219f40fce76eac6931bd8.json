It was, he grimly asserted, like being wrecked on a desert island with the Marx Brothers. But the arrival of Tipton Plimsoll at Blandings Castle considerably brightened the Colonel&amp;#039;s horizon. For Tip-ton was a rich young American and rich young Americans were, in the Colonel&amp;#039;s opinion, quite the most desirable companions for his daughter, Veronica, the dumbest beauty listed in the pages of Debrett. The stage was set for a great romance, or so the Colonel thought, and so it might have been had the knowledge of Freddie&amp;#039;s erstwhile engagement to Veronica been withheld from the jealous Tipton, or if Prudence, the Earl&amp;#039;s niece, had not been forcibly parted from her unsuitable lover, Bill Lister. On such incidents do great issues depend. However, Uncle Gaily, who combined the ready resource of a confidence trickster with the zeal of a cheerful crusader, intervened with an ingenious scheme to reunite the young lovers. It was a master-plan.\n\nHow the plot miscarried at the crucial stage and in doing so caused a social and domestic revolution unparalleled in the history of Blandings Castle, is revealed in this most hilarious of chronicles. \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67e5ac42bb3ae9a6bab219f40fce76eac6931bd8","amp;dn":"P.G.+Wodehouse+-+Full+Moon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67e5ac42bb3ae9a6bab219f40fce76eac6931bd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,229,172,66,187,58,233,166,186,178,25,244,15,206,118,234,198,147,27,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
