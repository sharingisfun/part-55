Open the folder &quot;Western europe map&quot;. Click this folder with the right mouse button and then select &amp;#039;Paste&amp;#039;\nWhen the copy process is finished,\nYou can remove the memory card from the memory card reader and put it into your mobile telephone. Now, only the overlays still have to be activated. \nStart the TomTom navigation system and activate the new high accident area POIs under Manage OVI/OVI (de-)activation\nBy using the menu option &quot;Warn when close to OVI&quot; you can instruct the TomTom navigation system to issue a warning before all speed cameras.\n This warning can be set individually for each category (50 speed cameras, 100 speed cameras, and so on).\nAfter choosing the category, you can enter the distance as of which the TomTom navigation system should give you an acoustic warning\n\nWe recommend the following settings;of course, you are free to adjust the values to suit your needs: 10-30 km/h speed camera 100m \n40-80 km/h speed camera 250m \n90-130 km/h speed camera 500m \ndyn. speed camera 500m \ntraffic light speed camera 100m \nthen, select the warning signal for each category. The TomTom navigation system provides 15 different sounds. We recommend a short,\n terse sound in order to not disrupt any voice messages from the navigation program for any longer than necessary.\nWe recommend that you don&amp;#039;t activate the menu option &quot;Only warn if the POI is on the route&quot;.\nIf you activate this option, you will only be warned if the speed camera is on the route and on the same side of the road.\n Our speed camera database works with an accuracy of +/- 20m. Therefore, \nit is possible that the TomTom navigation system won&amp;#039;t recognise a speed camera,\n because the program would assume that the speed camera is on the other side of the road due to a slight deviation.\n In addition, there are also many speed cameras that are on the left side of the road but work in both directions or can be swivelled.\n Therefore, please don&amp;#039;t activate this item, and all speed cameras in your direction of travel with an angle of 90Ã‚Âº to the left and right,\n will be included in the warnings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c632dfcc89f739b2f478776f650b059a37d60f75","amp;dn":"TOMTOM+SPEEDCAMERA+EUROPE+MAY+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c632dfcc89f739b2f478776f650b059a37d60f75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,50,223,204,137,247,57,178,244,120,119,111,101,11,5,154,55,214,15,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
