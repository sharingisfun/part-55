So alienated from his own life that he makes the chronically depressed look perky, Hudson lives alone, watches The Golf Channel all day, can&amp;#039;t hang on to a relationship, shoplifts in order to get his adrenalin up off the floor, fears that thinking about his dad&amp;#039;s death will bring it to pass, loathes his mother, and in general, is as nutty as a crapshack in a peanut farm. Obsessed with the underlying sadness that infuses his wretched existence, Hudson is a man in hell, but he thinks that his long catalog of dismally unsatisfying and mutually self-destructive relationships is over when SARA stumbles into his life. He knows she can save him. She knows he has to save himself. Together they save each other.\n\n\nCast:\n\t\n        \n\tMatthew Perry\t... \tHudson\n\n\tBarry W.
