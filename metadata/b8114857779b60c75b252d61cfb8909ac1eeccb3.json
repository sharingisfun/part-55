Good news: this one is ten times better than DOD 2: Contagium. The bad news is that being ten times better is not enough to be a good movie. This movie redefines the term &quot;running zombies&quot;, this zombies are on fast forward all the time, the cgi-fx looks bad and its a complete non-sense (and not even funny) but its very action-packed and full of zombies every were. Looks like a Resident Evil rip-off some times. Mena Suvari is eye candy and Ving Rames have a very small role here. Its not a complete waste of time if you can watch it for free.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8114857779b60c75b252d61cfb8909ac1eeccb3","amp;dn":"Day+Of+The+Dead+DVDRip+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8114857779b60c75b252d61cfb8909ac1eeccb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,17,72,87,119,155,96,199,91,37,45,97,207,184,144,154,193,238,204,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
