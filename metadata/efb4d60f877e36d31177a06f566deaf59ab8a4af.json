The best example of the latter is &quot;Pouf Positive,&quot; a 14-minute AIDS saga, alternately sad, poignant, and uproarious. --Jeff Bateman \n\nProduct Description\nThe three-time Tony Award-winning actor and playwright(Torch Song Trilogy, La Cage Aux Folles, Independence Day, Mrs. Doubtfire, Bullets Over Broadway) releases a performance album that displays the multiple dimensions of his very special talent. Recorded live at New York&amp;#039;s Bottom Line, this provocative album includes stand-up comedy, two compelling dramatic monologues, and Harvey&amp;#039;s distinctive musical style. Hilarious, moving and completely entertaining, this album is destined to be a classic in the vein of Lenny Bruce and George Carlin. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/This-Not-Going-Be-Pretty/dp/B000007NGI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1211066027&amp;sr=1-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/This-Not-Going-Be-Pretty/dp/B000007NGI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1211066027&amp;sr=1-1&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efb4d60f877e36d31177a06f566deaf59ab8a4af","amp;dn":"Standup+Comedy+-+Harvey+Fierstein+-+This+Is+Not+Going+to+Be+Pret","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efb4d60f877e36d31177a06f566deaf59ab8a4af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,180,214,15,135,126,54,211,17,119,160,111,86,109,234,245,154,184,164,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
