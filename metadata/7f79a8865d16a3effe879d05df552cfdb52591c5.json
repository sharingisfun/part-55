He recorded with Jelly Roll Morton in 1930 (including a song titled &quot;Load of Cole&quot;) and played with the big bands of Blanche Calloway (1931-1933), Benny Carter (1933-1934), and Willie Bryant (1935-1936). His stint with Stuff Smith at the Onyx Club (1936-1938) gave him some recognition. Cole was well-featured with Cab Calloway&amp;#039;s Orchestra (1938-1942), playing in a strong rhythm section with Bennie Payne, Danny Barker, and Milt Hinton; his showcases included &quot;Crescendo in Drums&quot; and &quot;Paradiddle.&quot; Cole popped up in many different types of jazz and studio settings throughout the 1940s, and headed several record sessions with swing all-stars. He was with Louis Armstrong&amp;#039;s All-Stars (1949-1953), opened a drum school with Gene Krupa, and in 1957 toured Europe with Jack Teagarden and Earl Hines. A 1958 recording of &quot;Topsy&quot; became a surprise hit, allowing Cole to lead his own band throughout much of the 1960s; he also played with Jonah Jones&amp;#039; quintet later in the decade.
