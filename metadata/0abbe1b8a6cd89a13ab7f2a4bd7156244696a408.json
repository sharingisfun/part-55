In Clusterball, the player must collect as many balls as he can and then score them through a ring in the center of the stage to collect points. There are various weapons around the stage such as Ball Snatcher (to steal the balls from other players) Spaghetti String (to stick an enemy to the ground with a laser string) or Inverse Control (to invert the controls of the other player, making driving much more difficult).\n\nThe balls lie on magnetic ramps and the aircraft must somehow slide on these ramps to collect the balls. As the player tows more and more balls, which create a tail behind the aircraft, the aircraft becomes gradually heavier, therefore more vulnerable to enemy attacks.\n\nVery fun!\n\n--::Included is full game, a patch, and a update to OpenGL drivers if you need them::--","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0abbe1b8a6cd89a13ab7f2a4bd7156244696a408","amp;dn":"Clusterball+PC+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0abbe1b8a6cd89a13ab7f2a4bd7156244696a408","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,187,225,184,166,205,137,161,58,183,242,164,189,113,86,36,70,150,164,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
