So understand that the quality is such that if you try to watch it full screen on a 22-inch monitor, you will be disappointed.  On a reduced window in Quicktime however - it looks and plays great.  It is a nice piece of LOST to have during the 8-months away from our beloved show.  It won&amp;#039;t take up a lot of HD space, it is a clean edit (thank you Video ReDo), and a fantastic Finale.  Sorry for the delay.
