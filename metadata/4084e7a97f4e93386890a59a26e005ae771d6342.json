Professional version is mainly created for corporate and/or business users. There is no such a big difference between this Pro and Home Edition (which is available as a freeware copy; You get a legit serial number). I?m a user of Home Edition almost a year now, and i can say I?m happy with it. It doesn?t go crazy when it comes to scene keygens, cracks, patchs (like AVG for example) and most important, it?s not a (big) resource hog. There is a comparison table, so it?s up to you to decide will you go for freeware (Home) edition, keygenned (Pro) edition, or some other antivir; after all it?s personal choice?\n\nDescription: avast! 4 Professional Edition is a collection of award winning, high-end technologies that work in perfect synergy, having one common goal: to protect your system and valuable data against computer viruses. It represents a best-in-class solution for any Windows-based workstation.\n\nNOTE: Some AVs may recognize ?keygen.exe? as trojan ?Win32:Keygen-T? or ?Potentially harmful program Crack.AD? like in AVG?s case (what a tagging LOL :D ). Others big names like NOD32, Kaspersky, F-Secure found it to be clean. So, it?s false positive.\n\nRelease Name: Avast.Pro.v4.8.1201.Incl.Keymaker-CORE\nSize: 22.2MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4084e7a97f4e93386890a59a26e005ae771d6342","amp;dn":"Avast+Pro+v4.8.1201+Incl.+Keymaker-CORE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4084e7a97f4e93386890a59a26e005ae771d6342","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,132,231,169,127,78,147,56,104,144,165,154,38,224,5,174,119,29,99,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
