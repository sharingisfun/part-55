It&amp;#039;s easy to use, and performed flawlessly throughout all of my testing. I found it a delight to use, and it doesn&amp;#039;t require any professional skill whatsoever to get it to work. As long as users have a simple webcam, and preferably a separate microphone, they should be able to get up and running quickly, creating their own video logs in no time flat.&quot;\n\nNetwork World\n5 out of 5 stars\n\n&quot;Vlog It can cut down on the need for video-editing software, saving lots of time in the process.&quot;\n\n\nThe Detroit Free Press\n5 out of 5 stars\n\n&quot;Vlog It is targeted at bloggers who want to add video posts to their online journals, it also works great for families who would like to send video greeting cards, or schools that want to create a Web TV station for students and parents...The results look strikingly professional -- even with an inexpensive webcam -- and Vlog It&amp;#039;s simple approach for producing them is what makes the program stand out. 5 out of 5 stars.&quot;\n\n\nInternet Video Magazine\n\n    &quot;This is really cool.
