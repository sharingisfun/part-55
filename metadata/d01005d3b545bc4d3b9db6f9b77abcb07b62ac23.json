The director/ actor Fung revives classic Mafia topics with shades of black humor while tempering contentiousness of homosexuality with the love of father-and-son. \nShortly after Eason\\\\\\&amp;#039;s comedy hit Naked Ambition, he is back to offer you more of his big screen talents. Living with his homosexual friend Georgie (Daniel Wu), Sam (Eason Chan) is mistaken as the inheritor of the wealthy head of the Hong family. Clever enough to take advantage of his new found fortune he soon falls in love with the daughter (Karen Mok) of the Hong family\\\\\\&amp;#039;s biggest competitor ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢?ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦ \n\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n                                 General Information \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nType................. Movie \nPart Size............1 gigabyte \nVideo Format.........AVI (Xvid) \nVideo Bitrate........ 160 \nFPS..................: 30 \nGenre................: Drama / Gay interest \nIMDb Rating..........: 6.0 \nMovie Information....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407708/ \n\nGay-themed Asian films are pretty plentiful, but gay-themed comedies are a rare breed. Enter the Phoenix may seem like a gay-themed comedy, but frankly the gay aspect of the film can be removed totally without impacting the tale. Essentially it\\\\\\&amp;#039;s a new take on The Prince and the Pauper, where Sam (Eason Chan) assumes Georgie\\\\\\&amp;#039;s (Daniel Wu) identity and takes control of a Hong Kong triad. The only problem is that Georgie is gay, and Sam has to pretend to be gay, yet hide this pretension from the lackeys in the triad. So, essentially it\\\\\\&amp;#039;s a straight man playing a gay man playing a straight man, which is all fine and good until Sam falls in love with a rival triad boss; daughter Julie (Karen Mok). Meanwhile, Chow Siu (Stephen Fung), in an attempt to avenge his father\\\\\\&amp;#039;s death, wants to usurp the position of \\\\\\&quot;Georgie\\\\\\&quot;, and is willing to go to any lengths. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n                               Post Information \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n                        Posted by............ jebpac66 \n                        Posted on............ 5/5/2008 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Chinese Title: Daai lo oi mei lai \nDirector: Stephen Fung \nWriting Credits: Stephen Fung, Lo Yiu Fai \nCast: Eason Chan, Daniel Wu, Karen Mok, Chapman To, Law Kar-Ying, Stephen Fung \nGenre: Comedy \nCountry: Hong Kong \nLanguage: Cantonese \nYear Released: 2004 \nRuntime: 104 min ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d01005d3b545bc4d3b9db6f9b77abcb07b62ac23","amp;dn":"+Enter+the+Phoenix+2004+%28english+hard+encoded%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d01005d3b545bc4d3b9db6f9b77abcb07b62ac23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,16,5,211,181,69,188,77,59,157,182,249,183,122,188,176,123,98,172,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
