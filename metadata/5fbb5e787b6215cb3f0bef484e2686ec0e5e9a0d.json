He sang while he shined shoes, and his boss liked the sound so well that he paid for music lessons for the boy. Enjoying the lessons, Vale started singing in high school musicals and at a local club. This led to additional club dates, including one that lasted for three years at a club in the suburb of Yonkers, New York, just north of the city. When Paul Insetta, (who was a road manager for Guy Mitchell and a hit songwriter) heard him there, he signed him to a management contract, changed his name, and further coached him. He then arranged for Vale to record some demonstration records of songs he&amp;#039;d written, and brought the demos to Columbia Records. Vale then signed a recording contract with Columbia Records, and Insetta managed him for many years.\n\nHis version of the National Anthem, recorded in the late 1960s, was a fixture at sporting events for many years.\n\nVale and Rita, his wife of over forty years, reside in Los Angeles, California. His autobiography, A Singer&amp;#039;s Life, was published in 2000 by Celebrity Profiles, Long Island, New York.\n\n\n\n\n\nJerry Vale - It&amp;#039;s Magic  1965\n\n01 - It&amp;#039;s Magic\n02 - Tears (For Souvenirs)\n03 - Big Wide World\n04 - Be Anything (But Be Mine)\n05 - Is It Asking Too Much?\n06 - My Melancholy Baby\n07 - For Me\n08 - Ashamed\n09 - My Prayer\n10 - Red Sails In The Sunset\n11 - If It Isn&amp;#039;t In Your Heart\n12 - Solitude\n\n\n\n\n\nJerry Vale - I Remember Buddy  1958\n\n01 - I&amp;#039;ll Get By (As Long As I Have You)\n02 - If You Were Only Mine\n03 - Linda\n04 - I Still Get A Thrill (Thinking Of You)\n05 - Peg O&amp;#039; My Heart\n06 - The Very Thought Of You\n07 - Stay As Sweet As You Are\n08 - Girl Of My Dreams\n09 - It Had To Be You\n10 - How Are Things In Glocca Morra?\n11 - Sleepy Time Gal\n12 - All Dressed Up With A Broken Heart\n\n\n\n\nJerry Vale - The Same Old Moon  1959\n\n01 - The Same Old Moon\n02 - Magic Is The Moonlight\n03 - In The Chapel In The Moonlight\n04 - Moonlight Becomes You\n05 - Give Me The Moonlight, Give Me The Girl (And Leave The Rest To Me)\n06 - A Strawberry Moon (In A Blueberry Sky)\n07 - The Moon Is My Pillow\n08 - Heaven Drops Her Curtain Down\n09 - How High The Moon\n10 - This Is The Night\n11 - No Moon At All\n12 - Moonglow","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fbb5e787b6215cb3f0bef484e2686ec0e5e9a0d","amp;dn":"Jerry+Vale+++3+Albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fbb5e787b6215cb3f0bef484e2686ec0e5e9a0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,187,94,120,123,98,21,203,63,11,239,72,78,38,134,236,14,94,154,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
