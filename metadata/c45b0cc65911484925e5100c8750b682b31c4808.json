Well what can i say, i actually like it, for a start it eliminates gold farmers and the botting taboo that every other game gets. It also allows casual players to be hardcore and hardcore gamers to get a life if they want to.\nDobry:\n?The 2D graphics seem quite dated at first, but as I&amp;#039;m outfitting my avatar I&amp;#039;m noticing some subtle goodies and improvements I haven&amp;#039;t noticed in other F2P&amp;#039;s. \nThe crafting system I think is one of the best I&amp;#039;ve seen among the F2P grindfest mmo&amp;#039;s.  I still prefer Mabinogi&amp;#039;s approach, but again I&amp;#039;m enjoying this one a lot?\nFunerest:\n?I&amp;#039;ve been playing MWO since early into the first phase of its closed beta. I was immediately drawn in by the integrated bot system. I&amp;#039;d definitely recommend this game to anyone out there who hasn&amp;#039;t already found it! Especially now that it&amp;#039;s entered phase 2 of the closed beta with open registrations...\nasciirider:\n?The game DOES encourage interaction and trading, by making the skills and equip you need drop less often than any other drops you may get so it stimulates the economy...\n... Good way to stop gold farming bots and level the playing field when ANYONE who wants to can bot...Not just the ones who cheat to do it?\nLunani:\n...don&amp;#039;t underestimate this game. the graphics are not the best but it&amp;#039;s pretty unique features like video chat or bot system make it to an uncut diamond. I wouldn&amp;#039;t be surprised if bigger companies steal their ideas...\nChuck Brazzel\ngraphics aren&amp;#039;t great, but the gameplay is good... continue to play... \nGenius:\n?Although it&amp;#039;s a 2D game, it&amp;#039;s probably one of the best games I&amp;#039;ve played, with nice and helpful GMs that communicate with players and actually try to help?\n\nGame Reviews: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://my.mmosite.com/cesarsuki/Blog/Item/ce386dbf5976c7ec66777df52e4554b8.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://my.mmosite.com/cesarsuki/Blog/Item/ce386dbf5976c7ec66777df52e4554b8.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://mwo.enjoymmo.com/forum/thread-127-1-1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://mwo.enjoymmo.com/forum/thread-127-1-1.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://mwo.enjoymmo.com/forum/viewthread.php?tid=257&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://mwo.enjoymmo.com/forum/viewthread.php?tid=257&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://mwo.enjoymmo.com/forum/viewthread.php?tid=224&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://mwo.enjoymmo.com/forum/viewthread.php?tid=224&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://mwo.enjoymmo.com/forum/viewthread.php?tid=353&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://mwo.enjoymmo.com/forum/viewthread.php?tid=353&lt;/a&gt;\n\nScreen Shots:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://images.filefront.com/Magic+World+Online_Screenshots_Pictures/;130616;0;/screenshot.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://images.filefront.com/Magic+World+Online_Screenshots_Pictures/;130616;0;/screenshot.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGameplay Videos:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c45b0cc65911484925e5100c8750b682b31c4808","amp;dn":"Magic+World+Online+-+New+Concept+MMORPG+Build+0409","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c45b0cc65911484925e5100c8750b682b31c4808","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,91,12,198,89,17,72,73,37,229,16,12,135,80,182,130,179,28,72,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
