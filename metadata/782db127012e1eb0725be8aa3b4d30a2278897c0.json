Narrated by TRUMAN CAPOTE. In color. Emmy Award winning adaptation of Capote&amp;#039;s recollection of his youth in the rural South during the Depression. Living with a slightly dotty but loving &quot;cousin,&quot; Capote remembers back to when he was about 10 years old and it was suddenly decided that &quot;it was fruitcake weather.&quot; The task of baking 30 cakes for mostly far-away friends and the other rituals of Christmas time are painted with such loving and nostalgic strokes, this becomes a truly beautiful Christmas experience. The poverty of the 1930s fails to stop or even slow down a loving relationship at a loving time of the year. An Emmy Award well deserved! \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:782db127012e1eb0725be8aa3b4d30a2278897c0","amp;dn":"Truman+Capote%5C%27s++A+Christmas+Memory+%28In+Color%29.UIF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"782db127012e1eb0725be8aa3b4d30a2278897c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,45,177,39,1,46,30,176,114,91,232,170,59,77,48,162,39,136,151,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
