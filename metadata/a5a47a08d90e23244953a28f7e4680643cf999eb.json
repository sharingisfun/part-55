He was the undisputed heavyweight champion and remains the youngest man ever to win a world heavyweight title. He was well-known for his controversial behavior both inside and outside the ring.\n\nNicknamed &quot;Iron Mike&quot; and &quot;The Baddest Man on the Planet,&quot; Tyson won his first 19 professional bouts by knockout, 12 in the first round. He unified the belts in the splintered heavyweight division in the late 1980s. Tyson was the undisputed heavyweight champion for over two years, before losing to 42-to-1 underdog Buster Douglas in 1990.\n\nIn 1992, Tyson was convicted of raping a beauty pageant contestant, for which he served three years in prison. After being released from prison in 1995, he engaged in a series of comeback fights. He regained a portion of the heavyweight title, before losing it to Evander Holyfield in 1996 by an 11th round TKO. Their 1997 rematch ended in disqualification for Tyson after he bit off a portion of Holyfield&amp;#039;s ear. He fought for a championship again at 35, losing by knockout to Lennox Lewis in 2002. Tyson retired from competitive boxing in 2005 after consecutive losses to journeymen.\n\nTyson declared bankruptcy in 2003, despite receiving over US$30 million for several of his fights and $300 million during his career.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5a47a08d90e23244953a28f7e4680643cf999eb","amp;dn":"Documentary.Mike.vs.Tyson.SWESUB.PDTV.XviD-APB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5a47a08d90e23244953a28f7e4680643cf999eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,164,122,8,217,14,35,36,73,83,162,143,126,70,128,100,60,249,153,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
