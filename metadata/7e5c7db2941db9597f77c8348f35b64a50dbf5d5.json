Radiohead always puts on a good one.  I got the whole thing, and it sounds pretty damn good.  Thank the equipment, not me.\n\nSome girl in a white shirt sneaked into our section and was really loud.  She was immediately to my left, so when she screamed it would clip the entire left channel.  Oh, and right after Fake Plastic Trees, you can hear her say &quot;thanks man.&quot;  This is because some random sound guy just handed her the set list.  Fucking interloper bitch.  She only screams a couple times during songs, though, so it&amp;#039;s not that bad.\n\nWe were sitting about 25 yards from the stage under the pavilion on the right side (stage left).  Excellent audio despite a slight reverb from the pavilion.\n\nTech data:\n\n-Recorded on an Olympus DS-30 Stereo Digital Audio Recorder, using an Olympus ME51S Stereo Electret Condenser Mic\n\n-Processed with Nero Wave Editor as follows:\n Declicked where necessary.  I erred on the side of &quot;not enough&quot; so there was no    noticeable loss in audio data.  There was quite a bit of crackle in places due to clipping.\n Pulled the whole recording down -3dB using the Normalize function.  This helped tremendously with residual clipping.\n \n-Exported to 192kb MP3 using Audacity.\n \n\nI&amp;#039;m considering posting the entire unmodified recording, depending on feedback.  I didn&amp;#039;t do it in the first place because it&amp;#039;s fucking 1.9GB.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nI&amp;#039;m considering posting the entire unmodified recording, depending on feedback.
