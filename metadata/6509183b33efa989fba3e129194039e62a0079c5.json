The Holy Grail for me: the MGM Region 3 DVD of the complete original version of the film from BEFORE they cut 15 minutes and tacked on a happy ending.  Unlike the cut-and-paste put-it-back-together-with-a-bad-convention-tape AB Boomstick.  And yes, this rip is Region Free.  Complete ISO file ready to burn.  Includes full menu and same extras as AB version (Commentary, Deleted Scenes, Alternate Ending (Hail To The King, Baby!), Photo Gallery, Theatrical Trailer.  Delayed justice can sometimes be best: Anamorphic Widescreen better than I&amp;#039;ve seen in us release and Dolby 5.1 so score and surround mix finally get their due, released in time for the 10 year anniversary of my favorite Bruce Campbell film.\nUntil this version shows up on Blu-Ray (as if) this is my pick.\nHope you like the sugar, Baby!\n\nYear: 1992\nRunning time: 96 min.\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: English, Cantonese, Mandarin, Korean, Thai, Bahasi, Spanish, Portuguese.\n\nOh, and is the Bad Ash meets Sheila scene more complete than AB?  Hmmm, could be.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6509183b33efa989fba3e129194039e62a0079c5","amp;dn":"Army+of+Darkness+MGM+Holy+Grail+version","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6509183b33efa989fba3e129194039e62a0079c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,9,24,59,51,239,169,137,251,163,225,41,25,64,57,230,42,0,121,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
