Unable to crack the U-Boat radio codes, the U.S. struggles blindly against the German onslaught -- that is until the crew aboard the S-33, a vintage World War I submarine, is assigned a dangerous mission that, if successful, will have the power to turn the tide of battle permanently. Led by Commander Mike Dahlgren and Lt. Andrew Tyler, the S-33 crew is ordered to capture Enigma, the German&amp;#039;s top-secret coding device. To bait the Germans, the S-33 is rigged to resemble a stranded Nazi U-Boat. If all goes according to plan, the crew will take the Germans as prisoners and steal Enigma -- if the plan fails, nine U.S. soldiers will be trapped in a submarine in the middle of hostile, enemy waters with little or no chance of survival.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23906617f1f0ae8ab833e260870a5db4744998c0","amp;dn":"U-571%5B2000%5DDvDrip%5BEng%5D-MEAB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23906617f1f0ae8ab833e260870a5db4744998c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,144,102,23,241,240,174,138,184,51,226,96,135,10,93,180,116,73,152,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
