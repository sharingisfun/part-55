It will be deleted in the future.\nGet the new one from here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5993917/TTC_VIDEO_-_Biology_and_Human_Behavior_%28compressed_version%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5993917/TTC_VIDEO_-_Biology_and_Human_Behavior_%28compressed_version%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nExplanations:\nInitially, I made this torrent private, not knowing exactly I did so (utorrent issue).\nNow tpb doesn't allow private torrents anymore.\nSo I created a public torrent, copy of this:\n\nSorry for this situation.\nYou should:\n1. delete the old private torrent from you client (not the files:P).\n2. download the new public torrent\n3. open the torrent file with your torrent client.\n4. set the path to your old location (it will recognize every file)\n\nWhen you do correctly, the percentage of downloading the torrent will increase rapidly. This being a sign that your client recognized the old physical files.\n\nStep 4 could be a little tricky.\nIn my case, I use utorrent.\nI customized it, so that it downloads first in a temporary directory. Then it moves the files to desired location (in my case label name, ie ttc)\nSo in my case, before downloading the new public torrent, I first move physical old files in temp directory. \nThen utorrent sees every file. It finishes the verification. Then it moves the files back where they should be.\n\n----------\nEND UPDATE\n----------\n\n\nTTC VIDEO - Biology and Human Behavior\n\nRobert Sapolsky &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.teach12.com/ttcx/coursedesclong2.aspx?cid=1597&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.teach12.com/ttcx/coursedesclong2.aspx?cid=1597&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nWhen are we responsible for our own actions, and when are we in the grip of biological forces beyond our control? This intriguing question is the scientific province of behavioral biology, a field that explores interactions among the brain, mind, body, and environment that have a surprising influence on how we behave-from the people we fall in love with, to the intensity of our spiritual lives, to the degree of our aggressive impulses. In short, it is the study of how our brains make us the individuals that we are.\n\nBiology and Human Behavior: The Neurological Origins of Individuality, 2nd Edition, is an interdisciplinary approach to this fascinating subject. In 24 lectures, you will investigate how the human brain is sculpted by evolution, constrained or freed by genes, shaped by early experience, modulated by hormones, and otherwise influenced to produce a wide range of behaviors, some of them abnormal. You will see that little can be explained by thinking about any one of these factors alone because some combination of influences is almost always at work.\n\n\nMore info: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.teach12.com/ttcx/coursedesclong2.aspx?cid=1597&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.teach12.com/ttcx/coursedesclong2.aspx?cid=1597&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nLectures:\n\n01.

It's the best converter/compressor I've used\n\n2. modify settings like this (or cut a little portion of video, then play around):\n 2.1 codec H264\n 2.2 set video width X 288 (width/288 must be equal to originalWidth/originalHeight)\n 2.3 set video bitrate somewhere between 240-270. I set it 240:P I didn't go lower.\n 2.4 set audio: mp3, audio bitrate 56kbs, sample rate 22050Hz\n\n3. Hit the button:D\nYou should get videos somewhere around 60-90 mb.\n\nThat's all\n(of course, then you create a torrent, then upload to tpb:D)\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db5a1452b060f311901ee0484cd8e5d88a1a9462","amp;dn":"TTC+VIDEO+Biology+And+Human+Behavior%2FBehaviour+%28Compressed+1.7Gb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db5a1452b060f311901ee0484cd8e5d88a1a9462","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,90,20,82,176,96,243,17,144,30,224,72,76,216,229,216,138,26,148,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
