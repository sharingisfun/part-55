The cast album for that show and a subsequent appearance on a studio revival of Pins and Needles were her first recordings. Signed to Columbia Records, she released her first album, The Barbra Streisand Album, in 1963. It became a Top Ten, gold-selling record, turning Streisand into one of the best-selling recording artists of the early &amp;#039;60s.\nBut despite three successful albums by early 1964, Streisand turned her back on potentially lucrative concert bookings in favor of a starring role in the Broadway show Funny Girl, in which she appeared for more than two years. &quot;People&quot; from that show became her first Top Ten single, and the People album her first chart-topping LP. She turned to television in 1965 with My Name Is Barbra, the first of five network specials. In 1967, Streisand went to Hollywood to film Funny Girl, for which she would win an Academy Award. But by 1970, with her second and third films flops and her recording career flagging in the face of rock, she seemed consigned to Las Vegas before turning 30. Instead, she returned to hit-making with a Top Ten cover of Laura Nyro&amp;#039;s &quot;Stoney End&quot; and a successful non-singing performance in the comedy The Owl and the Pussycat.\nIn the 1970s, Streisand successfully married her musical and film acting interests, first in The Way We Were, a hit film with a theme song that became her first number one single, and then with A Star Is Born, which featured her second number one single, &quot;Evergreen,&quot; a song she co-wrote. From that point on, every album she released sold at least a million copies. In the late &amp;#039;70s, she found recording success in collaboration: her duet with Neil Diamond, &quot;You Don&amp;#039;t Bring Me Flowers,&quot; hit number one, as did &quot;No More Tears (Enough Is Enough),&quot; a dance record sung with Donna Summer. She had her biggest-selling album in 1980 with Guilty, which was written and produced by Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees and contained the number one hit &quot;Woman in Love.&quot; In 1983, Streisand&amp;#039;s first directorial effort, Yentl, became a successful film with a Top Ten soundtrack album. In 1985, The Broadway Album returned her to the top of the charts. 1991 saw the release of Just for the Record..., a boxed set retrospective, and her second film as a director, The Prince of Tides. Streisand returned to the concert stage in 1994, resulting in the Top Ten, million-selling album The Concert. In 1996, she directed her third film, The Mirror Has Two Faces, and in 1999 she released A Love Like Ours.\nThe 2000 album Timeless: Live in Concert was recorded at her Las Vegas show on New Year&amp;#039;s Eve 1999 and released on both CD and DVD. A year later, the new holiday album Christmas Memories arrived, then a sequel to The Broadway Album, The Movie Album, appeared in 2003. In 2005, a deluxe CD/DVD reissue of the original Guilty was followed a month later by Guilty Pleasures, a new album that reunited Streisand with Gibb. In 2006 she returned to the concert stage, documented in the 2007 Sony release Live in Concert.\n\nReview\tby William Ruhlmann\n\nA concept album of sorts in the sense that each of the songs has something to do with water, Wet was the third of a trilogy of albums produced by Gary Klein in a soft rock vein increasingly set in the synth-pop style of the late &amp;#039;70s and early &amp;#039;80s. The concept allowed for a range of material, from old favorite Harold Arlen&amp;#039;s &quot;Come Rain or Come Shine&quot; to an updated version of the old Bobby Darin hit &quot;Splish Splash.&quot; The album&amp;#039;s number one hit was &quot;No More Tears (Enough Is Enough),&quot; a disco duet with Donna Summer. But most of the songs were newly written ballads attempting to re-create the &quot;Evergreen&quot;/&quot;The Way We Were&quot; style of Streisand&amp;#039;s recent hits. &quot;Kiss Me in the Rain&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&quot; grazed the Top 40, but most of that material was substandard. Yet there was enough variety on the album to make it an average Streisand outing. \n\nEnjoy.
