Edward travels to the private island of Summerisle, where Willow lives in an odd community that plant fruits, and she reveals that Rowan is actually their daughter. Along his investigation with the hostile and unhelpful dwellers, Edward discloses that the locals are pagans, practicing old rituals to improve their harvest, and Rowan is probably alive and being prepared to be sacrificed. When he locates the girl, he finds also the dark truth about the wicker man.\n\nThis is a proper DVDRip so please seed\n\nHappy downloading\n\n\nJunkyCez","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a74d590b80b27b37b1d78644a676a84b7578bdd3","amp;dn":"TheWicker.Man.%282006%29.DVDRip-JunkyCez.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a74d590b80b27b37b1d78644a676a84b7578bdd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,77,89,11,128,178,123,55,177,215,134,68,166,118,168,75,117,120,189,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
