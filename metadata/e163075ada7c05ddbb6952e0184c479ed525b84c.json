Last year when they played the much-delayed Cellulite Soul in its entirety at one of those alleyway venues Melbourne is known for, a sizable chunk of the audience walked out covering their ears. At the time I thought there must have had been a mistake, but no ÃƒÂ¢?? the record is just as loud. The band plunder the bottom-end of Australian underground music history ÃƒÂ¢?? bassist Ash Buscombe boasts an impressive collection of original Scientists singles ÃƒÂ¢?? and play pop songs that sound as if they&amp;#039;d spent twenty years in a trashcan before stumbling to life. One of the more merciful things about hearing Witch Hats on record is being able to turn them down occasionally.\n\nCellulite Soul&amp;#039;s first track &amp;#039;Before I Weigh&amp;#039; kicks off with a warbled scream and a guitar so distorted it would make The Jesus And Mary Chain proud. Kris Buscombe&amp;#039;s voice is almost inaudible ÃƒÂ¢?? the album doesn&amp;#039;t come with a lyric sheet, by the way ÃƒÂ¢?? before all four of them join in to sing a catchy but incomprehensible chorus twice in a row. That&amp;#039;s more or less the formula for Cellulite Soul ÃƒÂ¢?? two parts dumpster and one part melody. Half-way through there&amp;#039;s a particularly good song called &amp;#039;HellHole&amp;#039;, which is probably the loudest of the bunch and one of the rare moments you can understand the lyrics. Each verse is a play on the first one: &quot;Dude, stop sitting in the apple tree/ The damn thing&amp;#039;s shaking violently.&quot; The apple tree eventually falls on top of the protagonist and drags everyone into the &quot;hellhole&quot; of the chorus. There&amp;#039;s something so childish and sinister about that track, placed right at the very heart of Cellulite Soul, that speaks volumes. Witch Hats play a kind of music close to my heart ÃƒÂ¢?? the abyss as pop song. This is a brilliant album.\n\nby Andrew Ramadge\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.messandnoise.com/releases/2000027&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.messandnoise.com/releases/2000027&lt;/a&gt; (Accessed 15/03/2008)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e163075ada7c05ddbb6952e0184c479ed525b84c","amp;dn":"Witch+Hats+-+Cellulite+Soul+%5B2008%2FMP3%2FV0%2FLog%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e163075ada7c05ddbb6952e0184c479ed525b84c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,99,7,90,218,124,5,221,187,105,82,224,24,76,71,158,213,37,184,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
