The band only lasted a month, but almost everything got recorded. The line-up was as follows:\n\nMichael Vile - drums, guitar, vocals\nDale Hickey - guitar, vocals\nCasey Scrotum - guitar, bass, vocals\nTammy Cuntrag - drums, recorder, vocals\n\nThe tape was released with the title &quot;Flying Monkey Butts &amp; Purple Violins&quot;. It has since been retitled &quot;Toilet Bowl - Monkey Butts Revisited&quot; as it has been remastered and stuff.\n\n2) The Hinge - A year after Orchidalgia, Andy Warstar went to northern Idaho to go to the U of I during the height of the grunge era. While he was trapped amidst wheat fields and missing all the cool music on the coast, he started a hippie punk band with a couple kids who answered the advertisement he put up all around school (which read &quot;ever want to snort coke with Def Leppard? then this band is for you!)\n\nAlthough the band played three gigs and was together for about a year, the drummer never wanted to record much. Andy Warstar, then known as just Mike, insisted, and so here, you get both demo tapes combined into one full album. the line-up was as follows:\n\nMike 1 (Mike Tysoe) - guitar, vocals\nMike 2 (Mike Liles)- drums\nJoshua Boyd - bass guitar\n\n*************************\n\nso there&amp;#039;s everything that got recorded by Andy Warstar prior to becoming Andy Warstar and playing with Andy Warstar and the Warstars.
