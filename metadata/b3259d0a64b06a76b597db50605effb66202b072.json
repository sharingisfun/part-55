As well as discussing methods of gas production, it also discusses the safety and environmental concerns associated with the presence of natural gas hydrates, ranging from their possible impact on the safety of conventional drilling operations to their influence on Earthâ€™s climate.\r\n\r\n&quot;Methane Gas Hydrate&quot; is a useful reference on an increasingly popular energy source. It contains valuable information for chemical engineers and researchers, as well as for postgraduate students","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3259d0a64b06a76b597db50605effb66202b072","amp;dn":"Methane+Gas+Hydrate","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3259d0a64b06a76b597db50605effb66202b072","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,37,157,10,100,176,106,118,181,151,219,80,96,94,255,182,98,2,176,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
