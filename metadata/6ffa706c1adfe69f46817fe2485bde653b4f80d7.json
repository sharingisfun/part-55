OpenSolaris has everything you need to take your brilliant idea, build a prototype, test it, deploy it, and run it on production servers?out of a loft, or across your enterprise. And when your app goes viral, you won?t have to throw hardware at the problem, or switch to a different OS. OpenSolaris is industrial strength and built to scale from the get go.\n\nThe Live CD makes it simple to boot to a fully functional desktop environment, including Firefox and Thunderbird. Try it without fear -- our instant rollback feature works like a giant undo button, so your system is always protected, and you&amp;#039;ll never lose work. And, you can load OpenSolaris 2008.05 easily in a variety of virtualization technologies including the open source VirtualBox hypervisor.\n\nExperience it now!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ffa706c1adfe69f46817fe2485bde653b4f80d7","amp;dn":"Open+Solaris+2008.05","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ffa706c1adfe69f46817fe2485bde653b4f80d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,250,112,108,26,223,230,159,70,129,127,226,72,91,222,101,59,79,128,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
