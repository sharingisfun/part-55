The eight musical pieces, which range from free and crazy jazz to wildly undisciplined mathcore, passing through indie, prog, pop, hard-core and much more, have now been sensitively and successfully interpreted by Raffaele Marchetti, who in only three months has entered into a perfect symbiosis with Valerian Swing&amp;#039;s paranoiac instrumentals during the creation their second release &quot;Draining Planning for Ears Reflectors&quot;.\n\nValerian Swing&amp;#039;s arrogant rhythm section totally avoids 4/4 rhythm and adores playing parts of boat and rubber saxophones. Its bassist hates the bass but plays the bass very well to his chagrin. Its guitars are played extremely psychedelically and vacillate between sounding stoned and meticulously orchestrated. Its voice starts out as pop and then crescendos until it reaches beyond the beyond. The only thing left to do is listen carefully.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c92f21818400297930f327bc25b2e9ca75e07ca","amp;dn":"Valerian+Swing+-+Draininganning+for+Ears+Reflectors+-+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c92f21818400297930f327bc25b2e9ca75e07ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,146,242,24,24,64,2,151,147,15,50,123,194,91,46,156,167,94,7,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
