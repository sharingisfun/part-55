Donkey Kong is loosely based on the 1981 arcade game of the same name and its sequel Donkey Kong Jr. The game is also known as Game Boy Donkey Kong (as seen in the title screen) and also Donkey Kong Ã‚Â´94 (the promotional title before release) to differentiate it from the 1981 arcade game. Like in the original arcade and NES version, the player takes control of Mario and must rescue Pauline from Donkey Kong (who are both given updated character designs for this game). Donkey Kong Jr. also appears in the game and serves as a hindrance to MarioÃ‚Â´s progress.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d79c2e09241fa30dae3b0ea378313d47ea5cfb45","amp;dn":"Donkey+Kong+%5BPAL+-+Wii+-+VC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d79c2e09241fa30dae3b0ea378313d47ea5cfb45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,156,46,9,36,31,163,13,174,59,14,163,120,49,61,71,234,92,251,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
