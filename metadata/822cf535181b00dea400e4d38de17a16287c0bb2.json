First there was Janne (guitar), Jukka (bass), Jonttu (drums) and Jukkis (vocals). Their original plan was to make music without any lead guitars but then it turned out to be a bit boring. Teemu joined the band and so Misery Inc. were complete.\nDebut album &quot;Yesterday&amp;#039;s Grave&quot; was released through ZYX Music 2003. It received amazing feedback from metal media all over and made the band&amp;#039;s name known in metal scene. Summer 2005 MI signed a deal with Firebox Records and on February 2006 MI proudly present the second album &quot;Random End&quot; which really proves that Misery Inc. has found their style and are stronger than ever, showing how their misery is formed into kick-ass riffs, catchy melodies, and strong vocals - all in very melancholic and moody fashion.\n\n2003 - Yesterday&amp;#039;s Grave\nBitrate: 320 Kbps\nGenre: If you ask me, M.inc is melodic moody melancholic metal\nSize: 77,9 MB\nLength: 33:57\n\n01 - Suicide Serenade.mp3\n02 - Darkness.mp3\n03 - Life Ain&amp;#039;t Fair.mp3\n04 - Dilemma.mp3\n05 - No More.mp3\n06 - Through The Dark.mp3\n07 - Darkest Night.mp3\n08 - Prayer.mp3\n09 - Share My Madness.mp3\n10 - Fade Away.mp3\n\n2001 - Chains (demo)\nBitrate: 320 Kbps\nSize: 22,0 MB\nLength: 9:36\n\n01 - Pray.mp3\n02 - Chains.mp3\n03 - Darkest Night.mp3\n\n\n2002 - For Your Misery Only (demo)\nBitrate: 320 Kbps\nSize: 22,8 MB\nLength: 9:57\n\n01 - Black Dawn.mp3\n02 - No More.mp3\n03 - Dreams to End.mp3\n\n\n2003 - Suicide Serenade (demo)\nBitrate: 320 Kbps\nSize: 42,2 MB\nLength: 18:25\n\n01 - Suicide Serenade.mp3\n02 - Darkness.mp3\n03 - Life Ain&amp;#039;t Fair.mp3\n04 - Follow.mp3\n05 - Hated.mp3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:822cf535181b00dea400e4d38de17a16287c0bb2","amp;dn":"Misery+Inc+-+Yesterday%5C%27s+Grave+%2B+3+demos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"822cf535181b00dea400e4d38de17a16287c0bb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,44,245,53,24,27,0,222,164,0,228,211,141,225,122,22,40,124,11,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
