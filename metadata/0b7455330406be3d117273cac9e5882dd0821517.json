If you've never heard of it, I highly reccomend this download.\n\nThis is my first torrent.  I'm in the process of collecting all the other Samurai Jack DVDs, so keep an eye out for more.\n\nAlso, I don't plan on seeding this until the end of time, so don't waste bandwidth downloading it unless you're seriously planning on seeding until you've &quot;paid back&quot; what you've &quot;taken&quot;.\n\nFor those of you who don't understand how a torrent works, here's the short version:\n\nIf you don't seed until you've uploaded 100% of what you've donwloaded then one of two things happens:  either A. someone else uploads 200% making up for what you didn't upload or B. the torrent dies, and you're the last person to get it.\n\nDon't be a dick.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b7455330406be3d117273cac9e5882dd0821517","amp;dn":"Samurai+Jack+-+The+Premiere+Move+%28DVD9%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b7455330406be3d117273cac9e5882dd0821517","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,116,85,51,4,6,190,61,17,114,115,202,201,229,136,45,208,130,21,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
