Here Akhenaten would shrink the old world of 2,000 gods to 1. He would give his queen - the beautiful Nefertiti - equal status and he would radically change art and society. He set out to create the greatest city the world had ever seen and it appeared he had succeeded. But the pharaoh?s great city would last just 20 years. \n\nFor over a century archaeologists have been excavating the ruins at Amarna. But recently a team under the directorship of Prof. Barry Kemp (University of Cambridge) has made a remarkable discovery. For the first time they have unearthed, in a desert cemetery, the skeletons of Amarna?s workers; the people who built and lived in the city. \n\nWhat these 3,500 year old human remains are revealing, is a city very different to what was previously thought. Far from being a place of plenty, biological anthropologist Prof. Jerry Rose (University of Arkansas) has discovered trauma on the vertebrae of youths in Akhenaten?s city, the evidence of backbreaking work. High rates of Anaemia ?particularly in the bones of children - is evidence of a chronic diet. \n\nWith unique access to a 30-year long project, using dramatic reconstruction and Computer Generated Imaging, Timewatch reveals the hidden truths of life in Amarna, during one of the most turbulent periods of Egyptian history - the time of the rebel pharaoh.\n\n\nFurther Information\nOU Timewatch page\nRelated Documentaries\nAncient Voices\nEgypt - Beyond the Pyramids\nNefertiti Resurrected\nNefertiti and the Lost Dynasty\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\nGSpot v2.70a avi file details:\n------------------------------\nFilename.....:\nFilesize.....: 669,577,152 bytes\nRuntime......: 49:07.800 (73695 frames)\n\nVideo Codec..: XviD ISO MPEG-4 (B-VOP//)\nVideo Bitrate: 1682 kbps\nAspect Ratio.: 672x384 (1.750)\nFramerate....: 25.000 fps\nBitstream....: Unpacked\n\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 125kbps 2ch VBR 48000Hz\nLanguage.....: English\nSubtitles....: Yes - English:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1779a41535199962679e9e1d0f541d7869acc43","amp;dn":"BBC+Timewatch+2008+The+Pharaoh%5C%27s+Lost+City+DVBC+XviD+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1779a41535199962679e9e1d0f541d7869acc43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,119,154,65,83,81,153,150,38,121,233,225,208,245,65,215,134,154,204,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
