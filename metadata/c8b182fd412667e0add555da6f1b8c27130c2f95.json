Thomas Layne \n&gt; \n&gt; Plot:\n&gt;\n&gt; A sudden death tied to a list from the past leads to \n&gt; unimaginable evil. Fresh out of law school and full of \n&gt; hope for the future, Renny Jacobson is stunned by his\n&gt; father&amp;#039;s sudden death--and then by the terms of the will:\n&gt; the elder Jacobson has left the bulk of his estate to charity.\n&gt; For his only son, he has left nothing more than the contents of\n&gt; a deposit box and interest in a company no one has heard of--\n&gt; the Covenant List of South Carolina, Ltd. When Renny encounters \n&gt; lovely Jo Johnston, meets the members of &quot;The List,&quot; and discovers \n&gt; the staggering value of his father&amp;#039;s mysterious bequest, his hope \n&gt; is resurrected. But why is Jo, to whom he is deeply attracted, so\n&gt; reluctant for him to claim his rightful share? Renny feels the\n&gt; supernatural power of the 140-year-old covenant--feels it and \n&gt; wants it for himself. But when his life and Jo&amp;#039;s begin to unravel,\n&gt; he is forced to face the truth about &quot;The List.&quot; And nothing short\n&gt; of a miracle will save them from its grasp.\n&gt;\n&gt; BE AWARE OF BOGUS SITES AND LAMERS\n&gt;\n&gt; DOWNLOAD YOUR DUQA FILES FROM DUQA ACCOUNTS\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ENJOY!\n&gt;\n&gt; CLIP\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Official sites\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8b182fd412667e0add555da6f1b8c27130c2f95","amp;dn":"The+List.%5B2007%5DDVDRIP.XVID.%5BEng%5D-DUQA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8b182fd412667e0add555da6f1b8c27130c2f95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,177,130,253,65,38,103,224,173,213,85,218,111,27,140,39,19,12,47,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
