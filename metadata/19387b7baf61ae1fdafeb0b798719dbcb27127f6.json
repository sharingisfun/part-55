I know. I don't like removing it either, but\r\nthere is no updated source image for LTSB version. It would\r\nmake the iso about a gig larger to include it.\r\n-Upgrade files have been re-added to iso. I could explain but\r\nit would take up too much room. The tradeoff is that netfx3 is\r\nnot integrated by default and will re-download the missing lang\r\ncomponents if you install it when you run update check next time\r\n\r\n*IMPORTANT NOTICE*\r\n-I may run out of the ability to upload these in the very\r\nnear future. I don't want to raise undue alarm, but a lot\r\nof people have come to enjoy these releases, so I feel like\r\nI at least owe them warning.\r\n-It could literally stop at any time, any day now.\r\n-I'll at least post a note on my KAT general comments if this\r\nhappens.
