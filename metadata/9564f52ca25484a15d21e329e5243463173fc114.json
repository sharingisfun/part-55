For some the wounds of 1890 still run deep.\n\nAs do the social problems on the reservation ? Many Lakota Sioux say the US government is failing them. They are among the poorest people in the country. Life expectancy for men on the reservation is just 44, the child mortality rate is the highest in the US.\n\nFilmed in Arizona, New Mexico, South Dakota and Nevada, Frontline USA gives a voice to Native Americans, and listens to their views on the presidential election.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/404C0A42-9B23-4011-9273-D463AC74EAF9.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/404C0A42-9B23-4011-9273-D463AC74EAF9.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSoS = http://www.sonofshun.com/forums \n\nCap: shunster x- \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9564f52ca25484a15d21e329e5243463173fc114","amp;dn":"Frontline+USA%3A+Politics+of+Native+Americans+%28Al-Jazeera%29+2008+03","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9564f52ca25484a15d21e329e5243463173fc114","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,100,245,44,162,84,132,161,93,33,227,41,229,36,52,99,23,63,193,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
