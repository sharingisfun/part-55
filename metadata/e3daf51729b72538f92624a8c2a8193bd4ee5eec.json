Part of it is my respect for tradition.  Another reason is that these shows occur just a little more than a year apart, and both are scorching performances.  And both occur at the Baltimore Civic Center.\n\nBaltimore Jack is the name of the game.  Recorded on 6-11-72 and 7-23-73 in Baltimore, Maryland, there&amp;#039;s a world of difference between the shows - the setlists are very different, reflecting the release of Houses Of The Holy.  And while the sound quality of the 1972 show is quite good, the 1973 show is muffled and distant.  This is probably the reason they come together, honestly.  I wouldn&amp;#039;t offer the 1973 show by itself if I had to - it&amp;#039;s just not up to snuff sound-wise to stand on its own.  But in a package with the 1972 show, it&amp;#039;s a nice set and if you can struggle through the recording, well, you&amp;#039;ll see. \n\nI dug for quite a while to find a replacement for the 1973 portion of the show, but TDOLZ apparently got the best one, and that&amp;#039;s what you&amp;#039;re getting here.  If there&amp;#039;s a better version of the 1973 show that one of you guys have, please let me know, cause I&amp;#039;d love to hear a great audio copy of it and put it out there for everyone else to hear too.\n\nDetails:\n\nBand: Led Zeppelin\nTitle: Baltimore Jack\nDate: June 11, 1972 &amp; July 23, 1973\nVenue: Civic Center, Baltimore, MD, USA\nLabel: The Diagrams Of Led Zeppelin\nNumber: TDOLZ VOL.96\nSource: Silvers &gt; EAC &gt; WAV &gt; FLAC Frontend &gt; FLAC\n\nDisc 1\n1 Immigrant Song\n2 Heartbreaker\n3 Black Dog\n4 Since I&amp;#039;ve Been Loving You\n5 Stairway To Heaven\n6 Going To California\n7 That&amp;#039;s The Way\n\nDisc 2\n1 Tangerine\n2 Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\n3 Dazed And Confused\n4 What Is And What Should Never Be\n5 Moby Dick\n\nDisc 3\n1 Whole Lotta Love\n2 Rock And Roll\n3 Communication Breakdown\n\nDisc 4\n1 Rock And Roll\n2 Celebration Day\n3 Black Dog\n4 Over The Hills And Far Away\n5 Misty Mountain Hop\n6 Since I&amp;#039;ve Been Loving You\n7 No Quarter\n8 The Song Remains The Same\n9 The Rain Song\n\nDisc 5\n1 Dazed And Confused\n2 Stairway To Heaven\n\nDisc 6\n1 Moby Dick\n2 Heartbreaker\n3 Whole Lotta Love\n4 The Ocean\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3daf51729b72538f92624a8c2a8193bd4ee5eec","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+1972.06.11+and+1973.07.23+-+Baltimore","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3daf51729b72538f92624a8c2a8193bd4ee5eec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,218,245,23,41,183,37,56,249,38,36,168,194,168,25,59,212,238,94,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
