I think this movie is a pretty solid 7 so I&amp;#039;m glad to see that&amp;#039;s pretty much where it is. But enough of that, onto the movie itself.\n\nReleased around the same time (and probably competing for much of the same audience) as the fantastic Donnie Yen movie Flash Point, Invisible Target provides some legitimate competition, albeit in the same sort of tired fashion of OCB cops doing the wrong things for the right reasons. If you&amp;#039;re at all a fan of HK cinema you&amp;#039;ve no doubt seen this plot done to death but for some reason you&amp;#039;re still a sucker for it. The fight scenes are very well done (would you expect any less from Jackie Chan&amp;#039;s son?), the movie seems for the most part well paced, and it&amp;#039;s got a solid story.\n\nNow for the bad news. There&amp;#039;s not much mind you, but there&amp;#039;s some. First of all, for me, the movie seemed too long for it&amp;#039;s own good. Yeah, it&amp;#039;s only 2 hours but at points it feels stretched and padded for time. Where Flash Point is quite a bit shorter, it leaves you wanting a little more whereas Invisible Target makes you feel like you got too much. And the glass, oh the glass! Don&amp;#039;t get too attached to anything breakable in this movie because it will invariably be punched through, kicked through, or fallen through. HK glass makers no doubt loved this movie...it&amp;#039;s putting their kids through university.\n\nAll in all I&amp;#039;d definitely recommend this movie to anyone who&amp;#039;s a fan of contemporary kung fu...just make sure you&amp;#039;ve got a good chunk of time set aside to watch it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69c7754213209354349aee92cf0845d360716d9c","amp;dn":"Invisible+Target+%282008%29+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69c7754213209354349aee92cf0845d360716d9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,199,117,66,19,32,147,84,52,154,238,146,207,8,69,211,96,113,109,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
