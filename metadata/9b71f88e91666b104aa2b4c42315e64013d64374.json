That said\n you'll be hard pushed to find this set ANYWHERE, and they're\n great if you're not an audio-nazi!\nI've ID3 tagged them (V2.something) using Kid3, properly, so\n they'll sit nicely in your MP3 player for your journey to\n work!\n\n==========================\n  Here man, that's mint!  \n==========================\n\nParticular favourites are:\n  The Count Of Monte Cristo\n  Cleopatra\n  Fall Of The House Of Usher\n\n=============\n  Nota Bene  \n=============\n\nI don't know all the Narrators, but a few of them are there, if\n anyone can comment with updates on THEPIRATEBAY only, it'd be\n rather nice!\nAlso, categorized under Music rather than Audio book, the reason\n is that the project was to help educate the 'yoof' about modern-\n classical literature.
