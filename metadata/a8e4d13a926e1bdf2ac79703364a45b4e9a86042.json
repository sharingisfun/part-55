His styles matured from early acid house, techno and Italian house, to trance, electro and hard house. \n\nHe played at many large events throughout Scotland namely at several RezerectionÃƒÂ¢??s, Fantasia, Awesome 101, Streetrave, The Bunker, The Fubar, Meltdown and for 2 years was resident at the legendary Calton Studios in Edinburgh.  \n\nDell also ran the now famous Global Records, a dance music specialist vinyl shop in Edinburgh, which was a pioneer in setting the house music trend for the east of Scotland.  Global Records used to provide the weekly top 10 dance chart to the late great Tom Wilson for his Stepping Out show on Radio Forth and were very much involved in building the Edinburgh dance scene with Tom Wilson.\n\nAfter a 12 year break from the industry DJ Dell has returned playing venues throughout New York City including a residency at The Hacienda Club NYC, which caters for the Expat Brit community in New York City.  DJ Dell spins classic old skool house mixed with fresh upfront electro beats and funky house.  The success of the Hacienda Club NYC is unprecedented, with a membership close to 1000 already.\n\nCheck out DJ DellÃƒÂ¢??s mixes past and present\n\nDJ_Dell_Live_In_New_York_City_Uplifting_House_Mix_Oct_07\n\n\nVisit DJ DellÃƒÂ¢??s Official Site Here. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.djdell.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.djdell.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVisit DJ DellÃƒÂ¢??s MySpace Page\n\nVisit DJ DellÃƒÂ¢??s MixUpload.com Page &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mixupload.com/DJDELL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mixupload.com/DJDELL&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVisit The Hacienda Club NYC Official Site &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thehaciendanyc.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thehaciendanyc.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVisit The Hacienda Club NYC Meetup Site &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://housemusic.meetup.com/52/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://housemusic.meetup.com/52/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\ndj, djs, dell, scotland, uk, dance, music, house, rezerection, electro, techno, trance, calton, rez, rave, global, record s,nyc, the hacienda, club, new, york, city, old, skool, classic, classics, house, retro, funky, Edinburgh, record, shop, clubscene, rez, bunker, fantasia, awesome 101,meltdown,brit,Scottish,uk,rave,school,dance\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8e4d13a926e1bdf2ac79703364a45b4e9a86042","amp;dn":"DJ_Dell_Live_In_New_York_City_Uplifting_House_Mix_Oct_07","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8e4d13a926e1bdf2ac79703364a45b4e9a86042","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,228,209,58,146,110,27,223,42,199,151,3,54,74,69,180,233,168,96,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
