More information at http://meetthegimp.org\n\nThis work is licensed under a\nCreative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Germany License.\t\n\n\nEpisode 035: A Pack of Filters\n\nThis week I show you how to change the colour, lightness and saturation of an image with the Filter Pack. You can do it in any order, undo every step and the best thing: you have a preview of every possible change at the same time that gets constantly updated. Confused? Watch the video! BTW, the control can be much finer and subtle than on the thumbnails on this image here.\n\nAt the beginning of the show I recommended the Lenswork publications. I forgot to mention that the editor, Brooks Jensen, also does two wonderful podcasts about photography.\n\nDon?t forget the challenge! Make a monochrome image and post it in our meetthegimp.org photogroup at 23 and be sure to use the tag ?mtg-monochrome?. The challenge ends March 31 1600GMT and I?ll draw a winner by random choice.\n\nYou can find the image used in this episode here on the Download Page\n\n\n\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da941c28cdd26cea7f0b520b9b871abbe89387ae","amp;dn":"Meet_the_Gimp_Videopodcast_Episode_035_FilterPack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da941c28cdd26cea7f0b520b9b871abbe89387ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,148,28,40,205,210,108,234,127,11,82,11,155,135,26,187,232,147,135,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
