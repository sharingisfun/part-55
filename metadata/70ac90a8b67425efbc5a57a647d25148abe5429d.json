IÃ‚Â´m not shure about the date , but i think it was 1996. One of the last concerts they played before splitting up. The sound is picked up from an old stereo microphone, and I would say itÃ‚Â´s rather good concidering the method. Originally recorded on a portastudio casetteplayer, then processed in protools to crisp up the sound alittle bit. Then made into 320 kbps MP3.\n\nEnjoy !\n\nps. If you have any comments or questions IÃ‚Â´ll be happy to answer them if I can.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70ac90a8b67425efbc5a57a647d25148abe5429d","amp;dn":"At+The+Gates+-+Cafe+44+Live+-+1996","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70ac90a8b67425efbc5a57a647d25148abe5429d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,172,144,168,182,116,37,239,188,90,87,166,71,210,81,72,171,229,66,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
