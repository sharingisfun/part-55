Episodes 8-24 are\r\npresented in their original 16:9 aspect ratio.\r\n\r\nThere is a bit of discrepancy about the episode order. During the original airing, FOX cut the order from 24 to 20, and kept &quot;The Boy Can't Help It&quot; and &quot;To Sirloin With Love&quot;. The remaining 4 episodes were aired in syndication the following year on Adult Swim.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, we kept the episodes in the same order they're on the disc, which is also the production code order. Various websites label them as &quot;specials&quot;, though this is also inaccurate since they were meant to air in the original run.\r\n\r\nFinally, sometimes the bottom crop changes depending on the scene. Therefore we left it in instead of cropping","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01224ed97fcd90e305bbd2d55fd3b4b2cd3a63b0","amp;dn":"King.Of.The.Hill.S13.BDRip.x264-DEiMOS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01224ed97fcd90e305bbd2d55fd3b4b2cd3a63b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,34,78,217,127,205,144,227,5,187,210,213,95,211,180,178,205,58,99,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
