The NASA program supporting this endeavor is commonly known as International Space Station Phase 1. MISSION TO MIR is a filmed journal of this historic alliance. Filmed in space by the astronauts, this unprecedented 40-minute, giant-screen tour of Russia&amp;#039;s Space Station Mir gives viewers a unique look inside the weightless home in space that has been occupied by international teams of scientists since 1986. The film examines their relationships with Mir&amp;#039;s cosmonauts as they live, work and entertain in a zero-gravity environment. Join record-setting space pioneer Shannon W. Lucid with her colleagues inside their weightless home against a panorama of spectacular space scenery. \n\nMISSION TO MIR is a presentation of Imax Corporation and Lockheed Martin Corporation in association with The National Air and Space Museum and produced with the cooperation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). \n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: XviD \nVideo Bitrate: 2206 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x464\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.379:1\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 384kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Channels 6\nRunTime Per Part: 40:03\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 745mb (1/6 DVD)\nSubtitles: English \nRipped by: Dentje","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1eb373791050dd4506bc94821ec194e5ffaa6ad4","amp;dn":"IMAX+Mission+to+Mir+XviD+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1eb373791050dd4506bc94821ec194e5ffaa6ad4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,179,115,121,16,80,221,69,6,188,148,130,30,193,148,229,255,170,106,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
