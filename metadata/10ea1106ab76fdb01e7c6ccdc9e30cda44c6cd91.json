Well, here it is. The latest .cfg is included in the package, however, this will only work up until iTunes 7.5.0.20, so do not update iTunes any further, which is what I am doing. Everthing from the archive that was downloadable from the site is included. Have fun! It&amp;#039;s a great program!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10ea1106ab76fdb01e7c6ccdc9e30cda44c6cd91","amp;dn":"QTFairUse+Last+Available+Update","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10ea1106ab76fdb01e7c6ccdc9e30cda44c6cd91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,234,17,6,171,118,253,176,30,124,108,205,201,227,12,218,68,198,205,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
