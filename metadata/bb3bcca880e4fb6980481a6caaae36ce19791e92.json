He recorded several albums \nwith different jazz ensembles and musicians, mixing rock, \nblues, ragtime, swing, rhythm and blues and punk rock \ntogether. Some attention was brought to the band in the \nlate 1990s, during the swing revival. Big Rude Jake then \ndisappeared, and came back in 2006.\n\nFrom Brian, the drunken music nerd\nI highly recommend this - plus it has a funny title.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb3bcca880e4fb6980481a6caaae36ce19791e92","amp;dn":"Big+Rude+Jake+-+Live+Faust+Die+Jung","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb3bcca880e4fb6980481a6caaae36ce19791e92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,59,204,168,128,228,251,105,128,72,26,108,170,174,54,206,25,121,30,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
