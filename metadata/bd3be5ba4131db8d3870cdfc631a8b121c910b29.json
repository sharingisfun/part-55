Well, if you have just bought a new AVCHD\ncamera and want to edit the footage, you are\nusually stuck with having to fork out for a new\nediting package. These packages require a new-ish,\nhigh end PC. If you don&amp;#039;t have one of these,\nVoltaicHD is your answer.\n\nSince Voltaic HD decompresses your HD clips before\nyou use them in Movie Maker, your PC has a much\neasier time handling the full HD clips.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd3be5ba4131db8d3870cdfc631a8b121c910b29","amp;dn":"ShredWorx.VoltaicHD.v1.2.1-DVT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd3be5ba4131db8d3870cdfc631a8b121c910b29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,59,229,186,65,49,219,141,56,112,205,252,99,26,139,18,28,145,11,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
