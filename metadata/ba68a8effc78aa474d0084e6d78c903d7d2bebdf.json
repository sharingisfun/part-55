So here is the original 4 Disk (3 game + 1 installation) PC version.\n\nI have kept the files unzipped just in case anyone needed/wanted a particular disk Or if you wanted to download the install disk and disk 1 first, you could play while you download the others.\n\nMod example:\n\nBefore applying NPC Reconstruction Project Mod:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d104/YARDofSTUF/FF7/hands2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d104/YARDofSTUF/FF7/hands2.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAfter applying NPC Reconstruction Project Mod:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://fem1.uniag.sk/Miroslav.Jezik/ff7/samples/ffVII_3_after2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://fem1.uniag.sk/Miroslav.Jezik/ff7/samples/ffVII_3_after2.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAs you can see its much better. (for the eagle eyed amongst ya you&amp;#039;ll notice the hand is not the original in the first screen, that&amp;#039;ll be the hand mod)\n\nMod&amp;#039;s + Patches Info: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.qhimm.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=23acd0b6388b7b483ac7af556bcfc618&amp;board=3.0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.qhimm.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=23acd0b6388b7b483ac7af556bcfc618&amp;board=3.0&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGame Info: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://uk.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/finalfantasy7/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://uk.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/finalfantasy7/index.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFew tips to get it to work:\n\nChoose maximum installation of the game if you intend to apply mods\n\nApply official 1.02 Patch (most mods and extras are designed for this version)\n\nUninstall Codecs (VERY IMPORTANT)\n\nTry not to die (moderately important)\n\nApply XP patch if uninstalling codecs does not help\n\nApply chocobo patch (will save problems later on)\n\nPossibly find a multipatcher (on the site i mentioned earlier) to save you hassle\n\nDo not buy a sword and swing it around like cloud, you will die, it will then not matter if the game works or not.\n\nI also have FFVIII and FFX for PC and PS2 respectively (PS2 emulator supplied). Not to mention FF Origins, FF4, FF5, FF6 and Tactics all for the PS1 (again emulator supplied)\n\nOhh and Vagrant Story plus the brilliant Xenogears also for the PS1.\n\nThanks and seed as much as you can,\n\nTake care,\n\nShorrtybearr\n\nP.s. I take no responsibility for any unfortunate accident you may experience after using anything this torrent offers, this includes accidental decapitation, throat cutting, wrist slashing, loss of girlfriend, sadness at loss of girlfriend, fascination over Tifa, sadness at fascination over Tifa, family disownment because of Tifa fascination and so on.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba68a8effc78aa474d0084e6d78c903d7d2bebdf","amp;dn":"Final+Fantasy+VII+PC+%28Not+Ultimate+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba68a8effc78aa474d0084e6d78c903d7d2bebdf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,104,168,239,252,120,170,71,77,0,132,230,215,140,144,61,125,43,235,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
