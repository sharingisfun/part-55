Skal discovered the legendary \nSpanish-language version of the 1931 Dracula in Cuba. Shot at night on the same \nUniversal sets as Tod Browning&amp;#039;s classic after, his crew went home for the \nevening, and using a translated version of the same script, this version \nfeatures a cast of Mexican and South American actors under the direction of \nGeorge Melford. When this version was released in 1992 in the U.S. (with \nsubtitles), a small but fervent coterie of fans proclaimed it superior to Tod \nBrowning&amp;#039;s original. While practically identical in many ways, Melford creates a \nmore atmospheric set and has his camera prowling though it in key moments, \nresulting in a more stylish and smooth film. He punctuates scenes with striking \ncompositions and startling close-ups and paces the film more evenly (even though \nit emerges 30 minutes longer ). Two elements stand out above all. The lovely \nLupita Tovar makes a much sexier Mina (named Eva here), signaling her \ntransformation to the dark side by rising from her bed in a low-cut, and very \nrevealing, nightgown, as if displaying her newfound sexual aggressiveness. The \nfilm&amp;#039;s sole weakness is Carlos Villar&amp;#039;s Dracula, who is nowhere near as \ncharismatic as Bela Lugosi. Though his portrayal improves over the course of the \nfilm, he never comes close to Lugosi&amp;#039;s intensity or aristocratic demeanor. \n--Sean Axmaker\n\n\n\n\nENG: This is my personal rip of the spanish DVD.  It contains in the same \nMatroska file the original spanish audio track, and five subtitles (italian, \nspanish, italian, portuguese and croatian) selectable during playback.\n\nYou need H.263 and AC3 codecs to play this.  I recommend using VLC Media\nPlayer, as it uses its own codecs.\n\nESP: Este es mi propio rip del DVD espa?ol.  Contiene en el mismo archivo \nMatroska la pista de audio original en espa?ol y cinco de subtitulos (espa?ol, \nitaliano, ingles, portugues y croata), intercambiables durante la reproduccion.\n\nEs necesario tener instalados los codecs H.263 y AC3 para reproducirlo.\nRecomiendo usar el VLC Media Player, pues ya los trae incluidos.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   Movie Details\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSynopsis: At midnight on Walpurgis Night, an English clerk, Renfield, arrives at \nCount Dracula&amp;#039;s castle in the Carpathian Mountains. After signing papers to take \nover a ruined abbey near London, Dracula drives Renfield mad and commands \nobedience. Renfield escorts the boxed count on a death ship to London. From \nthere, the Count is introduced into the society of his neighbor, Dr. Seward, who \nruns an asylum. Dracula makes short work of family friend, Lucia Weston, then \nbegins his assault on Eva Seward, the doctor&amp;#039;s daughter. A visiting expert in \nthe occult, Van Helsing, recognizes Dracula for who he is, and there begins a \nbattle for Eva&amp;#039;s body and soul.

The English-language version \nwas filmed during the day, and the Spanish-language version was filmed at night.\n\n    * This Spanish-language version runs nearly a half-hour longer than the \nEnglish-language version that was being shot during the day.\n\n    * Director George Melford did not speak or understand Spanish.\n\n    * Although this version was shot in Spanish, it became a mixture of dialects \nsince the cast came from Mexico, Spain, Central and South America.\n\n    * For decades, the only surviving print, while in mint condition, was \nmissing several minutes worth of material that encompassed Renfield&amp;#039;s seduction \nby the Dracula&amp;#039;s brides and the voyage to England. The &quot;lost&quot; reel was \neventually located in Cuba, and has been restored to complete the film as much \nas possible. Though much more worn and aged than the rest of the film, the \nadditional footage differs strikingly from the English-language version, \nprobably more so than any other part of the film.\n\n    * When this film was released on DVD in 2004 as part of the &quot;Dracula: Legacy \nCollection&quot;, it included closed captions for the hearing impaired, but did not \ncontain the straight English subtitles. Universal answered buyers&amp;#039; complaints by \ntelling them to simply select the &quot;closed captions&quot;.\n\n    * In the theatre scenes, the final shot of the ballet is borrowed from \nUniversal&amp;#039;s The Phantom of the Opera (1925).\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Personal Info\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy releases so far... personal rips from original DVDs, looking for quality...\nThey&amp;#039;re uploaded in TPB, Mininova and TorrentBox, but feel free to share them\non edonkey networks on any way you want.
