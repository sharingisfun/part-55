Arriving on the heels of the dismal &quot;One Missed Call,&quot; &quot;The Eye&quot; is at least a bit more dignified, cleanly telling its story and doing it with a modicum of know-how. Unfortunately, the film sorely pales in comparison to 2003&amp;#039;s Hong Kong original &quot;Gin Gwai.&quot; That one was rich in mood and fraught with intentionally drawn-out, tension-filled scenes that genuinely frightened and got under the skin. This updated edition is quite faithful until the dumbed-down Americanized ending, yet time and again the treatment is inferior. Especially disappointing is that behind the camera are French directors David Moreau and Xavier Palud, who previously made 2007&amp;#039;s white-knuckle suspenser &quot;Them&quot; (&quot;Ils&quot;); their genre talents have obviously been homogenized for their U.S. debut.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:865be8d357cf673b1a597aef7a4cbce6ae8b81fa","amp;dn":"The+Eye.rmvb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"865be8d357cf673b1a597aef7a4cbce6ae8b81fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,91,232,211,87,207,103,59,26,89,122,239,122,76,188,230,174,139,129,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
