(Thanks, Mrs Rodgers!)\r\n\r\nI am very pleased to now be able to offer the Danny Dunn collection in an eBook format for others to enjoyâ€¦\r\n\r\nWhat are â€œRegeneratedâ€ ebooks?\r\n\r\n-This is a collection of ebooks, which began their lives as hard copy books, then PDF Scans of individual pages,and in many cases, simply run through a converter to make them into EPUB and/or MOBI files. \r\nThe results were, to put it kindly, less than optimal.\r\nIâ€™ve tried to include the original artwork as best as I was able (a process made more difficult by having several of the original illustrations span two facing pagesâ€¦)\r\nI referred to my first collection of rebuilt eBooks as â€˜Regeneratedâ€™ , since they were Doctor Who eBooks, and I think the term is still appropriate.\r\n\r\nWhatâ€™s included in this collection?\r\n\r\n- All 15 original Danny Dunn books are recreated in this collection, based on the best examples of source materials I could find. See the â€˜Contents.rtfâ€™ file for a full list.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the â€œSource Filesâ€ folders, and do I need them?\r\n\r\n- Each Regenerated ebook folder contains a MOBI file (for Kindle eBook readers), a, EPUB file (for most other eBook readers), and a Source Files folder. The Source Files folder contains all the graphics files used in the regenerated eBook, as well as the RTF text file used to generate the eBook (and in many cases, the original PDF file, where I could find them). These files are only necessary if you wish to make modifications to the eBooks yourself. \r\nThese eBooks were created with Legend Maker for the Macintosh (available via the App Store, or the companyâ€™s own web site), and the RTF files are designed to be used with this utility. \r\nThe Source Files ARE NOT needed to use the resulting eBook files, and may be discarded at your discretion. HOWEVER, if you plan on re-distributing this collection, you should include these files.\r\n\r\nIâ€™ve found (and corrected) some errors. What do I do now?\r\n\r\n- At the time of this writing, this collection is wandering the internet, searching for a more permanent home. You may notice that each eBook has a version number placed in the upper right corner of the first page. My hope is that this collection will evolve, and further refined versions of eBooks will take the place of the eBooks Iâ€™ve regenerated for this collection.\r\nIf you find mistakes, either in the text, or can provide better renderings of the illustrations (and there are plenty of opportunities, I have no doubt), please make whatever corrections you deem necessary in the RTF file, or to the .jpg files and check back periodically where you found this collection. If/when a permanent home is located, contact information on where to send your corrections will be included in this read me file at a future date","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61df99a9ec26cffa3abb86e35b0c935c33b8b3c9","amp;dn":"Regenerated+e-Books+-+Danny+Dunn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61df99a9ec26cffa3abb86e35b0c935c33b8b3c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,223,153,169,236,38,207,250,58,187,134,227,91,12,147,92,51,184,179,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
