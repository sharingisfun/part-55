He and his people have conquered other lands and collected much booty. Although his queen, Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn) clearly disapproves, the assembled warriors and maidens clearly enjoy themselves. However, in a cavern not far from the mead hall, the singing and dancing is a painful nuisance to the misshapen half-human, half-demon Grendel (Crispin Glover). Enraged, Grendel attacks the mead hall and kills or maims many of the warriors. He spares Hrothgar&amp;#039;s life, however. After he returns to the cavern, his mother, a water demon (Mangelina Jolie) soothes him. The next day, Hrothgar orders the mead hall sealed and sends out a call for a hero to come and rid the kingdom of Grendel.\n\n\nIMDB link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0442933/\n\nDon&amp;#039;t forget to visit us at www.sharego.net !\n\nTotal file size: 1.23 GB\n\nTracker URL: http://www.sharego.net:2710/announce\n\nAVInaptic Report:\n\n[ About file ]\n\nName: Beowulf.mkv\nDate: 2/03/2008 00:27:21\nSize: 1,331,388,281 bytes (1269.711 MB)\n\n[ Generic infos ]\n\nPlay duration: 01:54:43 (6882.666 s)\nContainer type: matroska\nCreation time: 2/03/2008 05:25:57 UTC\nNumber of streams: 12\nType of stream nr. 1: video (V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC)\nType of stream nr. 2: audio (A_AAC (AAC Low complexity))\nType of stream nr. 3: subtitle (S_VOBSUB)\nType of stream nr. 4: subtitle (S_VOBSUB)\nType of stream nr. 5: subtitle (S_VOBSUB)\nType of stream nr. 6: subtitle (S_VOBSUB)\nType of stream nr. 7: subtitle (S_VOBSUB)\nType of stream nr. 8: subtitle (S_VOBSUB)\nType of stream nr. 9: subtitle (S_VOBSUB)\nType of stream nr. 10: subtitle (S_VOBSUB)\nType of stream nr. 11: subtitle (S_VOBSUB)\nType of stream nr. 12: subtitle (S_VOBSUB)\nAudio streams: 1\nMuxing Application: libebml v0.7.7 + libmatroska v0.8.1\nWriting Application: mkvmerge v2.1.0 (&amp;#039;Another Place To Fall&amp;#039;) built on Dec 31 2007 20:13:50\n\n[ Relevant data ]\n\nResolution: 720 x 304\nWidth: multiple of 16\nHeight: multiple of 16\n\n[ Video track ]\n\nCodec ID: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nResolution: 720 x 304\nFrame aspect ratio: 45:19 = 2.368421 (~2.35:1)\nPixel aspect ratio: 1:1 = 1\nDisplay aspect ratio: 45:19 = 2.368421 (~2.35:1)\nFramerate: 23.976024 fps\n\n[ Audio track ]\n\nCodec ID: A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)\nSample rate: 48000 Hz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b341dcef88ac7ccfe960cfcb2e145fcd9034867b","amp;dn":"Beowulf+SeCtIoN8+%7BSharegoRG%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b341dcef88ac7ccfe960cfcb2e145fcd9034867b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,65,220,239,136,172,124,207,233,96,207,203,46,20,95,205,144,52,134,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
