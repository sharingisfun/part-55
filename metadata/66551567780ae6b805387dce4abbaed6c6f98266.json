The three largest factions are racing to develop true weapons of mass destruction, the massive Titan class vessels. The democratic Korkyra is producing a titan class vessel that is based on the latest shield technology and will feature the strongest shields ever seen in the Gemini universe. Baeldor baronies are united together in an effort to quickly produce a space behemoth that can land a strong punch. The Nyxian consortium used its informants and monetary wealth wisely and is able to quickly join the race by taking what is not theirs: a titan class sized vessel based on Imperial Leviathan designs.\r\nJoin one of the factions in their worthy attempt and become the deciding factor.\r\nWelcome to project Titan.\r\n---\r\nStarpoint Gemini: Titans is an addition to the existing stories where players will be able to pick up where they stopped and simply continue on playing. Titans will give you a small taste of what Starpoint Gemini: Warlords, our next big project, is trying to achieve.\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: Windows 7 / 8 / 10\r\nProcessor: 2.2 GHz Dual core or equivalent\r\nMemory: 2 GB RAM\r\nGraphics: DirectX 10 compliant graphics card with 512MB RAM\r\nDirectX: Version 10\r\nHard Drive: 300 MB available space\r\nSound Card: DirectX compatible sound card\r\nMouse, Keyboard\r\n\r\nRecommended system requirements - Windows: Windows 7 / 8 / 10\r\nProcessor: 3.0 GHz Dual core or equivalent\r\nMemory: 4 GB RAM\r\nGraphics: DirectX 11 compliant graphics card with 1GB RAM\r\nDirectX: Version 11\r\nHard Drive: 300 MB available space\r\nSound Card: DirectX compatible sound card","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66551567780ae6b805387dce4abbaed6c6f98266","amp;dn":"Starpoint+Gemini+2%3A+Titans+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66551567780ae6b805387dce4abbaed6c6f98266","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,85,21,103,120,10,230,184,5,56,125,206,74,187,174,214,198,249,130,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
