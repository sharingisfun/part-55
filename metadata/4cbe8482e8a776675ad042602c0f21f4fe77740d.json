The movie is exactly the length of a DV Tape and a sub-plot is established by showing bits and pieces of video previously recorded on the tape that is being recorded over. The movie starts as a monster of unknown origin destroys a building. As they go to investigate, parts of the building and the head of the Statue of Liberty come raining down. The movie follows their adventure trying to escape and save a friend, a love interest of the main character.\n\n\n\nExcellent Quality :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cbe8482e8a776675ad042602c0f21f4fe77740d","amp;dn":"Cloverfield+%282008%29+DvDrip-Xvid+%28Eng%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cbe8482e8a776675ad042602c0f21f4fe77740d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,190,132,130,232,167,118,103,90,208,66,96,44,15,33,244,254,119,116,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
