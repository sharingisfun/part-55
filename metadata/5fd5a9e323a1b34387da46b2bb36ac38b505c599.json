With a full feature-set and aggressive pricing (inc. lifetime free updates), FL Studio may be your ideal DAW!\nFL Studio can be used as a scratchpad for your ideas or to produce completely mastered tracks ready for publication. It&amp;#039;s up to you! \n\nChief Software Architect, Didier Dambrin has realized his vision of creating an open-architecture virtual studio environment where the only constraint on the users is their own imagination. This philosophy is reflected in FL Studio 8?s flexible audio and control data routing, free-form Playlist design and interoperability with industry standards (VST/VSTi/VST2, DXi, DXi2, Buzz, ReWire, MIDI, MP3, WAV, OGG). Didier notes ?We don&amp;#039;t try to protect our data &amp; come up with new formats only for marketing reasons. We use existing standards as much as possible, and allow FL Studio to be used as a plugin in other hosts?. In version 8, particular emphasis has been given to improved workflow through enhanced interface design, so that ideas can be crystallized and creativity captured. \n\n\nNew Features in FL Studio 8\n\nFL Engine/Interface\nCleartype not forced on anymore for mixer labels for Win9X platforms (and there was much rejoicing!). \nAdded recording filter (right-click record button).
