In flashbacks told around a pretend car trip they take - so he can practice driving - we see Paul&amp;#039;s infancy, their fun together (sometimes with a manic edge), and his growing desire to go to school and be with other kids. We also flash back to Emily&amp;#039;s childhood, with parents so bound up with each other that she&amp;#039;s virtually ignored. Is Emily going to be able to let Paul be with others? Or, can she, as in the David Bowie song she sings at a school talent show, construct a life on Mars?\n\n\n Kyra Sedgwick ...  Emily \n\n Dominic Scott Kay ...
