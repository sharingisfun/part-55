There is a slight skip at the beginning of Sound of Muzak\nwhich is due to the stream. Split Hatesong as there was a natural pause. \n\ntooligan&amp;#039;s Notes:\nThis was a great matrix to work on, and one of the easiest to do. The Microtrack and R-09\nreally match up well. This is my first time using a SBD feed as a source, and all I can\nsay is WOW! This had to be one of the best sounding matrix recordings I&amp;#039;ve heard, and is \nhands down the best one I&amp;#039;ve done to date. I fixed the skips (there were actually 2 minor\nones) at the beginning of Sound of Muzak. The acutal matrix does not begin until about 1:32\ninto Fear of a Blank Planet, as that is where Dassari&amp;#039;s SBD feed began. The jam in the middle\nof Hatesong is the highlight of this show. Hardest to synch was Way Out of Here, with all the \nsynth effects, but got it in the end. All in all a must have for all Porcupine Tree fans.\nEnjoy!\n\nFINAL MIX notes:\nI had orginally posted this up on Dime, but it got banned because of the type of SBD feed. I\nwasn&amp;#039;t sure or not if it would be accepted. However a user made a comment there that it was \noutta synch, so I rechecked and somehow when I was mixing down the tracks, one of the files \ngot moved accidentally and threw off the synch off the other files. To err is human. So I fixed\nthe problem, and doubled even triple checked the files after mixing down, seems like I corrected\nit back to how it was before the mixup. Luckily I write down all the synch point times. So I \napologize to everyone who grabbed it the first time. You will enjoy this mix much better.\n\n**Do not sell, for trade ONLY!**\n***DO NOT CONVERT TO MP3!!!***\n\n\nThanks to &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bootlegmatrix.netgoo.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bootlegmatrix.netgoo.org/&lt;/a&gt;\nfuckin loaded with concerts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb5d4c7497e16ad14aa95ebe3ba0954a347e35b0","amp;dn":"Porcupine+Tree%3A+2007+Oct.+26th%2C+New+Orleans%2C+LA+%28matrix+source%29%28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb5d4c7497e16ad14aa95ebe3ba0954a347e35b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,93,76,116,151,225,106,209,74,169,94,190,59,160,149,74,52,126,53,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
