For more info or if you want to do a standard intallation on your PC go to:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/4034527/MediaMonkey_3.0.3.1140_Gold&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/4034527/MediaMonkey_3.0.3.1140_Gold&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Package contains a first version of the program made portable with the batch file that launches the program converted to an EXE with QBFC to avoid showing the relative DOS window, but that some AVs see sometimes as a virus. If your AV is one of them, or if you don&amp;#039;t trust too much in it, use the second one that runs directly the batch file. You will have the sloppy DOS window in the background but less complaints from antiviruses...\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e81820a8d4019049c4d46032334c5431fdda570c","amp;dn":"MediaMonkey+v3.0.3.1140+Gold+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e81820a8d4019049c4d46032334c5431fdda570c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,24,32,168,212,1,144,73,196,212,96,50,51,76,84,49,253,218,87,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
