Written by Wired.com editor Leander Kahney, The Cult of Mac is the first book about Macintosh culture, the largest subculture in computing. The Cult of Mac is an in-depth look at Mac users and their unique, creative, and often very funny culture. Like fans of a football team or a rock group, Macintosh fans have their own customs, with clearly defined obsessions, rites and passages. From people who get Mac tattoos and haircuts, to those who furnish their apartments with empty Mac boxes, this book details Mac fandom in all of its forms. This edition includes an all-new chapter about the iPod, updates throughout, and new photos that reflect current Apple technology.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ced714d6a6d4d2f5683109e05d769bac09cac48","amp;dn":"Cult+of+Mac+by+Leander+Kahney","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ced714d6a6d4d2f5683109e05d769bac09cac48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,237,113,77,106,109,77,47,86,131,16,158,5,215,105,186,192,156,172,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
